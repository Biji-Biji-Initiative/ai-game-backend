# Remaining Work for Backend Improvements

## Schema Validation
- [ ] Review and update any remaining Zod schemas that haven't been converted to strict mode
- [ ] Add comprehensive error messages to all schema validations
- [ ] Ensure all schema transformations have been removed
- [ ] Verify that all optional fields have been properly evaluated for required status
- [ ] Add input/output type definitions for all schemas

## Service Layer
- [ ] Implement consistent error handling across all remaining services
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging with context in all service methods
- [ ] Review and optimize cache invalidation patterns
- [ ] Standardize input validation at the start of all service methods
- [ ] Review and adjust TTL values for cached data across services
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics collection

## Repository Layer
- [ ] Extend custom error classes to remaining repositories
- [ ] Implement consistent parameter validation across all repositories
- [ ] Add comprehensive error context to all repository operations
- [ ] Standardize database field name conversion (camelCase to snake_case)
- [ ] Add debug and error logging to remaining repositories
- [ ] Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
- [ ] Add database transaction support where needed

## Controllers
- [ ] Enhance request validation across all endpoints
- [ ] Standardize error responses and HTTP status codes
- [ ] Add structured logging with request context
- [ ] Implement rate limiting where appropriate
- [ ] Add request validation middleware
- [ ] Standardize response formats

## Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests for new validation logic
- [ ] Create integration tests for error handling
- [ ] Add performance tests for cache operations
- [ ] Implement end-to-end tests for critical paths
- [ ] Add stress tests for error handling scenarios

## Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation with new validation rules
- [ ] Document error handling patterns and error codes
- [ ] Add examples of correct request/response formats
- [ ] Update architecture documentation
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common errors

## Monitoring and Observability
- [ ] Set up monitoring for new error types
- [ ] Add metrics for validation failures
- [ ] Create dashboards for error rates and patterns
- [ ] Implement alerting for critical errors
- [ ] Add tracing for request flows

## Security
- [ ] Review input validation for security implications
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for public endpoints
- [ ] Add security headers where missing
- [ ] Review and update access controls
- [ ] Implement audit logging for sensitive operations

## Performance
- [ ] Profile and optimize database queries
- [ ] Review and optimize caching strategies
- [ ] Implement connection pooling where needed
- [ ] Add query optimization hints where beneficial
- [ ] Review and optimize bulk operations

## Migration
- [ ] Create database migration scripts for schema changes
- [ ] Plan deployment strategy for breaking changes
- [ ] Create rollback procedures
- [ ] Document upgrade path for clients
- [ ] Plan data migration for existing records

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Remove deprecated code paths
- [ ] Clean up unused imports and dependencies
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate code
- [ ] Update outdated dependencies
- [ ] Remove redundant validation logic

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize the above tasks based on impact and complexity
2. Create detailed tickets for each task
3. Estimate effort required for each task
4. Plan implementation phases
5. Set up monitoring for the new changes
6. Create rollback plans for each phase
