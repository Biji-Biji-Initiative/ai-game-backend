## Definition of Done

The refactoring will be considered complete when:
1. All files pass TypeScript validation without errors
2. Unit test coverage is at least 80%
3. CI/CD pipeline is fully operational
4. No runtime errors occur during normal operation
5. All planned features work as expected
6. Documentation is complete and up-to-date
