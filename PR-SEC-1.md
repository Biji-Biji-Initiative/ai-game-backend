# PR: SEC-1 - Implement Comprehensive Authorization Checks

## üìù Description

This PR implements a comprehensive authorization system to ensure that all endpoints properly validate user access to resources. It addresses inconsistent authorization checks across the application and establishes a centralized approach to access control.

## üîê Key Changes

### New Components

1. **AuthorizationService**: Central service for access control decisions
   - Resource-based authorization with owner checks
   - Permission-based authorization
   - Special handling for different resource types
   - Comprehensive logging of authorization decisions

2. **Resource Authorization Middleware**:
   - `authorizeResource`: Generic middleware for resource-based authorization
   - `authorizeUserSpecificResource`: Middleware for user-specific resources
   - `requirePermission`: Middleware for permission-based authorization

### Updated Routes

1. **User Routes**: Enhanced with proper user-specific resource controls
2. **Challenge Routes**: Added owner-based resource authorization
3. **Evaluation Routes**: Updated to use central authorization middleware
4. **System Routes**: Strengthened admin-only requirement

## üß™ Testing

- Unit tests for AuthorizationService
- Unit tests for resource authorization middleware
- Tests verify all authorization scenarios (own resources, admin access, denied access, etc.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

The implementation follows these core principles:

1. **Ownership-based Access**: Users can access their own resources
2. **Role-based Access**: Admin users have elevated privileges
3. **Resource-specific Rules**: Different resource types have different access rules
4. **Centralized Policy**: All authorization decisions flow through the central service

## üöÄ Usage Example

Before:
```javascript
// Ad-hoc controller checks
if (evaluation.userId !== req.user.id) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Not authorized' });
}
```

After:
```javascript
// Consistent middleware approach
router.get('/:id', 
  authenticateUser,
  authorizeResource({
    resourceType: 'evaluation',
    paramName: 'id',
    action: 'read',
    getResourceOwner: getEvaluationOwner
  }),
  evaluationController.getEvaluationById
);
```

## üîç Security Impact

This change significantly improves the application's security posture by:

1. Ensuring consistent authorization checks across all endpoints
2. Preventing unauthorized access to user data
3. Implementing proper resource isolation
4. Adding comprehensive logging for security audits
5. Creating a foundation for more granular permission controls
