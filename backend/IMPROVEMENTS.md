# API Improvements Implementation

This document outlines the improvements made to the AI Fight Club API to address the pending tickets:

## 1. Swagger UI and OpenAPI Integration (Ticket 7)

- ✅ Added the refresh token endpoint to the OpenAPI specification in `openapi/paths/auth.yaml`
- ✅ Updated the OpenAPI index file to include the refresh endpoint in `openapi/index.yaml`
- ✅ Implemented the Swagger UI mounting in `app.js` to provide direct access to the API documentation
- ✅ Created a script to generate Swagger UI files in `scripts/generate-swagger-ui.js`
- ✅ Added an endpoint to serve the OpenAPI spec JSON at `/api-docs-json`
- ✅ Created a custom Swagger UI with a modern interface
- ✅ Configured OpenAPI validation middleware to validate requests against the schema
- ✅ Added scripts to automatically bundle the OpenAPI spec when starting the server

### Known Issues:
- The auth middleware may still block access to the Swagger UI in some cases
- Consider using a reverse proxy or separate server for the Swagger UI in production

## 2. Sentry Integration for Error Monitoring (Ticket 5)

- ✅ Added Sentry dependencies to `package.json`
- ✅ Added Sentry configuration to `.env.example`
- ✅ Created a Sentry setup file in `config/setup/sentry.js`
- ✅ Implemented Sentry initialization in `app.js`
- ✅ Added user tracking through auth middleware
- ✅ Implemented error capturing in the error middleware
- ✅ Added a test endpoint at `/sentry-test` for verification
- ✅ Registered Sentry services in the DI container
- ✅ Created helper functions for capturing exceptions

### Known Issues:
- Need to provide a valid Sentry DSN in `.env` file to enable error monitoring

## 3. API Versioning Standardization (Ticket 1)

- ✅ Added versioning configuration to the config object in `config.js`
- ✅ Created a versioning middleware in `core/infra/http/middleware/versioning.js`
- ✅ Added the versioning middleware to the middleware setup in `middleware.js`
- ✅ Standardized deprecation notices with headers and logging
- ✅ Added version information to all API responses
- ✅ Implemented multiple versioning strategies (URI path, query param, header, content-type)
- ✅ Added a version info endpoint to show API versioning status

### Known Issues:
- The version middleware needs to be registered before routes but after request ID and logging

## 4. CORS Configuration Improvements

- ✅ Enhanced CORS configuration to properly handle frontend requests
- ✅ Added support for pattern matching in allowed origins
- ✅ Improved logging of CORS decisions
- ✅ Added fallback options for missing configuration values
- ✅ Added proper handling of CORS preflight requests

### Known Issues:
- Need to set the correct frontend origin in `.env` file for production

## Next Steps

1. **Swagger UI Access**:
   - Consider using a reverse proxy to serve Swagger UI from a separate path
   - Implement a secure way to add authentication to Swagger UI

2. **Sentry Monitoring**:
   - Set up proper alert rules in Sentry dashboard
   - Configure performance monitoring thresholds

3. **API Versioning**:
   - Create a plan for versioning future API changes
   - Document the versioning strategy in the API documentation

4. **CORS Configuration**:
   - Test CORS settings with actual frontend deployment
   - Document the required CORS settings for frontend developers

## Implementation Details

### File Changes:

1. Added versioning middleware:
   - `src/core/infra/http/middleware/versioning.js`

2. Updated OpenAPI specification:
   - `openapi/paths/auth.yaml`
   - `openapi/index.yaml`

3. Added Sentry integration:
   - `src/config/setup/sentry.js`

4. Updated core files:
   - `src/app.js`
   - `src/config/setup/middleware.js`
   - `src/config/setup/swagger.js`
   - `src/config/config.js`

5. Added utility scripts:
   - `src/scripts/generate-swagger-ui.js`

### Configuration Requirements:

For all the above improvements to work, the following configuration is needed in the `.env` file:

```
# Sentry Configuration
SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1
SENTRY_PROFILES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1

# CORS Configuration
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourfrontend.com,https://*.yourfrontend.com
