# E2E Test Refactoring - Work Completed

## Overview

This document summarizes the E2E test refactoring work completed to improve the test suite. The goal was to update, relocate, or delete test files to ensure all tests are accurate, use correct endpoints, and provide robust validation.

## Work Completed

### 1. Updated Files

#### Ticket 5: Refactored `challengeGeneration.e2e.test.js`
- Updated all API URLs to use the `/api/v1` prefix
- Fixed endpoint for listing user challenges
- Enhanced assertions for generated challenge content:
  - Added checks for content length
  - Added keyword validation related to the challenge category
  - Added checks to verify text is meaningful
- Added test case that generates a focus area first, then creates a challenge using that focus area
- Improved test descriptions to clarify indirect persistence checks

#### Ticket 6: Refactored `evaluation.e2e.test.js`
- Standardized all API calls to use the `apiRequest` helper
- Fixed endpoints:
  - Using `POST /evaluations` for evaluation creation
  - Using `GET /evaluations/user/me` for user evaluations
  - Using `GET /evaluations/challenge/{id}` for challenge evaluations
- Enhanced assertions for AI evaluation results:
  - Verified score is within expected range (0-100)
  - Added feedback content length checks
  - Added validation for keywords in feedback text
  - Added validation for strengths and areas for improvement arrays
- Improved test descriptions to clarify persistence verification

#### Ticket 7: Refactored `focusArea.e2e.test.js`
- Updated to use correct endpoint (`POST /focus-areas/generate`)
- Enhanced assertions for generated focus area content:
  - Added checks for keywords in focus area name related to user profile
  - Added validation of description length and content
  - Verified skills are relevant and multiple skills are provided
- Improved test descriptions to clarify purpose and persistence verification

### 2. Files Already Relocated

The following files had already been correctly relocated before our work:
- `userPersonality.e2e.test.js` → `userPersonality.integration.test.js` (in integration tests)
- `challengeCycle.e2e.test.js` → `challengeCycle.integration.test.js` (in integration tests)
- `focusArea.e2e.test.js` → moved to correct `e2e/focusArea/` directory

### 3. Files Already Deleted

The following files that were marked for deletion had already been removed:
- `userManagement.e2e.test.js` (redundant with other user tests)
- `challengeEvaluation.e2e.test.js` (redundant with other evaluation tests)
- `promptTemplate.e2e.test.js` (tested outdated endpoints)

### 4. Additional Cleanup

- Deleted `simple-test.js` placeholder test file
- Deleted backup files

## Current State

The E2E test suite now covers all critical flows with improved reliability:

- **User & Auth**: User signup, login, profile management, token handling
- **Personality**: Profile updates, traits, attitudes, insights generation
- **Challenge Generation**: AI-powered challenge creation, listing, filtering
- **Evaluation**: Response submission, AI feedback, score validation
- **Focus Area**: Personalized focus area generation and retrieval

All tests:
- Use consistent helper functions (`apiRequest`)
- Include the correct `/api/v1` URL prefix
- Have thorough assertions for AI-generated content
- Verify persistence via subsequent GET requests
- Have clear test descriptions

## Conclusion

The E2E test suite is now in good shape and covers all the critical paths through the application. The tests are well-structured, use consistent patterns, and include thorough assertions to verify both functionality and data quality. This refactoring improves confidence in the test suite and its ability to catch regressions in the API.
