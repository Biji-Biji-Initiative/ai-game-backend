# Test Suite Refactoring - Progress Update

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1 - Infrastructure and Basic Compatibility

- ✅ **T1: Fix Test Import Paths**
  - Created `fix-test-imports.js` and `fix-source-imports.js` to correct import paths
  - Fixed relative imports in test files to align with src directory structure
  - Updated import statements to ensure proper module resolution

- ✅ **T2: Resolve Supabase Connectivity/Schema Issues**
  - Created `test-supabase-schema.js` to verify and set up the required database schema
  - Added checks for required tables and foreign key constraints
  - Implemented test user creation for test isolation
  - Fixed connection issues with Supabase client

- ✅ **T3: Fix OpenAI API Parameter Errors**
  - Updated OpenAI API client to use the new Responses API format
  - Fixed parameter formatting and error handling for OpenAI requests
  - Updated tests to expect the new response structure

- ✅ **T4: Fix eventBus Mocking**
  - Updated event bus mocking to properly handle domain events
  - Fixed sinon stub configuration for event bus methods
  - Ensured compatibility with ESM modules

- ✅ **T5: Update Tests for ESM**
  - Created scripts to convert CommonJS to ES modules
  - Fixed issues with missing `.js` extensions in import paths
  - Fixed `__dirname` and `__filename` usage in ESM context
  - Added proper handling for dynamic imports
  - Created a comprehensive ES Module migration guide

- ✅ **T7: Update Tests for Standardized Error Handling**
  - Created script to identify tests using generic Error
  - Developed `fix-error-handling.js` to replace generic errors with domain-specific ones
  - Updated error assertions to expect domain-specific error classes
  - Fixed catch blocks to catch specific error types
  - Applied fixes across all domains (challenge, user, evaluation, focusArea)

### Phase 2 - Domain-Specific Improvements (Complete)

- ✅ **T8: Update Tests for DI Implementation** (Complete)
  - Created `find-di-issues.js` to identify tests using non-DI patterns
  - Created `DEPENDENCY_INJECTION_PATTERNS.md` guide explaining best practices
  - Created `fix-di-patterns.js` to help automate migration from proxyquire to constructor DI
  - Refactored system-message.test.js as an example of proper DI
  - Refactored ChallengeCoordinator.test.js and PersonalityCoordinator.test.js to use DI
  - Created `fix-all-di-issues.sh` script to automate the refactoring process
  - Successfully refactored all identified files with proxyquire usage
  - Fixed direct dependency stubbing issues in multiple test files
  - Updated empty constructor instantiations to use proper DI patterns
  - Verified functionality of refactored tests
  - Removed all proxyquire and direct stubbing patterns from the codebase

- ✅ **T9: Update Tests for VOs, DTOs, Mappers** (Complete)
  - Created `find-vo-dto-issues.js` to identify primitive ID usage in tests
  - Created `fix-vo-usage.js` to automatically fix Value Object usage in tests
  - Created `fix-dto-mappers.js` to fix DTO mapper usage in E2E/API tests
  - Created `fix-all-vo-dto-issues.sh` to run the fixes for all domains
  - Fixed user, challenge, and focusArea tests to use proper Value Objects
  - Added proper DTO mappers to E2E/API tests in all domains
  - Updated a total of 24 files to follow correct VO and DTO patterns

### Phase 3 - Enhancement & Coverage (In Progress)

- ✅ **T11: E2E Test: Core User Authentication Lifecycle**
  - Created `auth.e2e.test.js` that covers the full authentication flow
  - Implemented tests for login with valid/invalid credentials
  - Added tests for accessing protected endpoints with/without valid tokens
  - Implemented token refresh testing using Supabase client
  - Added logout flow verification
  - Ensured tests work in both development and production environments
  - Made tests robust against API changes with flexible assertions

## Comprehensive Solution

We've implemented a robust test suite preparation script (`fix-test-suite.sh`) that:

1. Fixes import paths in both test and source files
2. Corrects module alias imports (`@/core` and `@/config`)
3. Converts any remaining CommonJS to ES modules
4. Fixes ESM-related issues like missing extensions and `__dirname` usage
5. Updates error handling to use domain-specific errors
6. Verifies and updates the Supabase schema
7. Runs basic tests to verify connectivity

## Next Steps

### Continue with Phase 3 - Enhancement & Coverage

- Begin work on Ticket #T12: E2E Test for Challenge Generation & Retrieval
- Implement E2E tests for Challenge Response & Evaluation (T13)
- Continue adding E2E tests for remaining key workflows (T14-T17)

## Documentation

We've created comprehensive documentation:

- `ESM_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Explains how to migrate from CommonJS to ES modules
- `DEPENDENCY_INJECTION_PATTERNS.md` - Explains DI best practices and refactoring patterns 
- `TEST_SCRIPTS_REFERENCE.md` - Reference for all test-related scripts
- Multiple scripts with detailed comments for future maintenance
- This progress update document to track the refactoring effort
