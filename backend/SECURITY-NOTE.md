# Security Note

## Addressed Vulnerabilities

We've addressed critical security vulnerabilities by updating:
- `@sendgrid/mail` to version 8.1.4
- `axios` to the latest version
- Replaced vulnerable `live-server` with secure `http-server` alternative

## Previously Noted Development Dependencies Vulnerabilities

~~There are still vulnerabilities in the `live-server` development dependency and its dependencies (`braces`, `debug`, `ms`). These vulnerabilities only affect local development and are not present in production, as `live-server` is only used for development purposes.~~

**FIXED:** The vulnerable `live-server` development dependency has been replaced with the secure `http-server` alternative. All related vulnerabilities have been resolved.

### ~~Options for completely resolving these vulnerabilities:~~

~~1. **Remove live-server if not needed**:~~
   ```bash
   npm uninstall live-server
   ```

~~2. **Replace live-server with an alternative**:~~
   ~~Consider using a more modern alternative like:~~
   ~~- `http-server`~~
   ~~- `serve`~~
   ~~- `browser-sync`~~

~~3. **Use only in controlled development environments**:~~
   ~~Continue using `live-server` but be aware that it should only be used in controlled development environments and never in production.~~

~~Since these vulnerabilities only affect development tools and not the production application, they are considered lower priority.~~

## Fixes Applied

- Uninstalled vulnerable `live-server` package
- Installed secure `http-server` alternative
- Updated npm scripts in package.json to use the new server
- Verified all vulnerabilities have been resolved with `npm audit`
