# E2E Test Circular Dependency Analysis
## Issue: Circular dependency found in E2E tests
The tests are failing due to circular dependencies between helper modules.
## Identified Dependencies:
- apiTestHelper.js imports loadEnv.js
- loadEnv.js is required by Mocha for test setup
- test files import apiTestHelper.js and also require loadEnv.js
## Suggested Solution:
1. Refactor the test helper structure to eliminate circular dependencies
2. Create a shared configuration module that is imported by both loadEnv.js and apiTestHelper.js
3. Move common utility functions to a separate module that doesn't have dependencies
4. Consider using dependency injection for the test environment configuration
