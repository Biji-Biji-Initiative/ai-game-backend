# API Versioning Migration Plan

## Overview

We are transitioning all API endpoints to consistently use the versioned path structure (`/api/v1/*`) instead of the unversioned path (`/api/*`). This document outlines the timeline, steps, and impact of this change.

## Timeline

1. **Phase 1: Deprecation Period (Current)** 
   - Unversioned `/api` routes continue to function but now return deprecation warnings
   - All client applications should begin migrating to `/api/v1`
   - Server logs will track usage of deprecated routes

2. **Phase 2: Migration Window (2 months from now)**
   - All client applications MUST complete migration to `/api/v1` endpoints
   - Monitoring of unversioned route usage continues

3. **Phase 3: Removal (3 months from now)**
   - Unversioned `/api` routes will return 410 Gone status with an informational message
   - Eventually, unversioned routes will be completely removed

## Required Client Changes

All client applications need to:

1. Update all API endpoint URLs to use the `/api/v1` prefix instead of `/api`
2. Update any hardcoded URLs in configuration files
3. Test all API interactions thoroughly after changes
4. Report any issues or concerns to the backend team

## Technical Details

- **Deprecation Headers**: During Phase 1, requests to `/api/*` paths will receive a response header `X-API-Deprecated: The /api path is deprecated. Please use /api/v1 instead.`
- **No Functional Changes**: The endpoints themselves, request/response formats, authentication mechanisms, etc. remain unchanged
- **Monitoring**: We are monitoring unversioned route usage to track migration progress

## Why This Change Matters

This standardization:

1. Prepares our API for future versioning needs (when v2 endpoints are needed)
2. Provides clarity in documentation and code
3. Follows API best practices for explicit versioning
4. Simplifies server-side routing
