echo "ADDITIONAL MANUAL STEPS REQUIRED:"
echo "1. For ESM compatibility:"
echo "   - Update test files to use import statements (see tests/domain/user/user.service.test.js)"
echo "   - Update source files to use export statements (see src/core/user/services/UserService.js)"
echo "   - Make sure .js extensions are included in import statements"
echo ""
echo "2. For EventBus Mocking:"
echo "   - Ensure tests/domain/setup.js or tests/setup/mockSetup.js provides a domainEvents mock"
echo "   - Inject the mock into services that use eventBus"
echo ""
echo "3. For Supabase connectivity:"
echo "   - Verify .env.test has correct SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY, and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
echo "   - Verify tests are using the client from the correct path"
echo ""
echo "4. For OpenAI API issues:"
echo "   - Update API calls to use the current OpenAI client structure"
