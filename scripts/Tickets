# Script Tickets Implementation Status

## Ticket 37: Delete Archived Scripts

The scripts/archive/ directory should be deleted as it contains obsolete scripts that are no longer needed.

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Deleted the scripts/archive directory.

## Ticket 38: Review and Refactor scripts/dev/ Directory

The scripts/dev/ directory needs to be reorganized by moving all scripts from subdirectories into the main dev directory.

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Moved all scripts from subdirectories to the main dev directory, preserved README files as README-*.md files, and deleted the empty subdirectories.

## Ticket 39: Consolidate or Remove Root-Level Utility Scripts

Root-level utility scripts need to be moved to appropriate directories or deleted if no longer needed.

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Moved schema-validator.js to scripts/utils/, moved verify-data.js to scripts/dev/, deleted list-tables.js and reset-supabase.js, and created a new Node.js implementation of verify-ddd-implementation.js in scripts/utils/.

## Ticket 40: Remove Obsolete fix_*.sh Scripts

While checking the codebase, we discovered that the fix_*.sh scripts mentioned in the ticket are not in the main scripts directory. However, there are similar fix-related scripts in the disabled_scripts directory. These should remain in the disabled_scripts directory since they've already been removed from the active scripts directory.

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Verified that fix_*.sh scripts are not in the main scripts directory.

## Ticket 41: Finalize scripts/README.md

The README files have been updated to reflect all the changes made in the previous tickets. Specifically:

1. `scripts/README.md` has been updated to:
   - Add details about the new scripts moved to utils/ and dev/
   - Remove mention of the archive/ directory
   - Add a new section on how to run specific tests
   - Update the directory structure description

2. `scripts/utils/README.md` has been updated to:
   - Add entries for schema-validator.js and verify-ddd-implementation.js
   - Add entry for cleanup-temp-scripts.js
   - Add the cleanup:scripts npm command

3. `scripts/dev/README.md` has been updated to:
   - Remove references to subdirectories
   - Add all script files that were moved from subdirectories
   - Organize scripts into logical categories
   - Add a note about converting test scripts to proper tests
   - Add an entry for the verify-data.js script

**Status**: ✅ Completed - All README files have been updated to reflect the new structure.

## Summary of Changes

The following changes have been implemented:

1. Package.json test scripts were already well-organized and didn't need changes (Ticket 36)
2. Deleted the scripts/archive/ directory (Ticket 37)
3. Flattened the scripts/dev/ directory structure by moving all scripts from subdirectories to the main directory (Ticket 38)
4. Moved utility scripts to appropriate directories and deleted unnecessary ones (Ticket 39)
5. Confirmed that fix_*.sh scripts aren't in the main directory (Ticket 40)
6. Updated all README files to reflect the changes (Ticket 41)

These changes have resulted in a cleaner, more maintainable scripts directory with clear organization and documentation.
