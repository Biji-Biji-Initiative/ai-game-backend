/**
 * Fix Supabase Import Issue - RESOLVED
 * 
 * This script was used to diagnose and fix the Supabase client import issues.
 * 
 * The issue has been resolved:
 * 1. The problem was in src/lib/supabase/index.js - it was exporting the client as default export only
 * 2. Fixed by adding named exports to support both import styles: 
 *    - const client = require('./src/lib/supabase')  // Default import
 *    - const { supabase } = require('./src/lib/supabase')  // Named import
 * 
 * All imports of Supabase clients should now work:
 * - Direct import: const client = require('./src/lib/supabase')
 * - Destructured: const { supabase } = require('./src/lib/supabase')
 * - Admin client: const { supabaseAdmin } = require('./src/lib/supabase')
 * - Factory function: const { createSupabaseClient } = require('./src/lib/supabase')
