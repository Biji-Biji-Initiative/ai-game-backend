- [x] Create docs/workflows/ directory
- [x] Create docs/domains/ directory for domain-specific docs
- [x] Create docs/external-apis/ directory
- [x] Create placeholder README.md files in each directory

### Task 2.2: Create Root Documentation Files
- [x] Create main docs/README.md as navigation hub
- [x] Create SETUP.md for installation and configuration
- [x] Create QUICK_START.md for minimal getting started steps
- [x] Create CONTRIBUTING.md for contribution guidelines
- [x] Create TESTING.md for testing procedures
- [x] Create DEPLOYMENT.md for deployment instructions
- [x] Create GLOSSARY.md for terminology reference

### Task 2.3: Migrate Core Content
- [x] Create external-apis/openai-responses-api.md with proper integration details
- [x] Create external-apis/supabase.md with proper integration details
- [x] Consolidate domain-event-system.md and architecture/domain-events.md
- [x] Combine prompt-builder-facade.md and prompt-system-design-patterns.md
- [x] Organize domain documentation in the domains/ directory

## Phase 3: Content Revisions

### Task 3.1: Update API References
- [x] Ensure all API documentation reflects Responses API exclusively
- [x] Remove all references to Chat Completions API
- [x] Update docs/STATEFUL_CONVERSATIONS.md with correct paths and component names
- [x] Update docs/evaluation-system.md to use Responses API terminology
- [x] Update code examples to use current patterns and structures

### Task 3.2: Fix Paths and Component Names
- [x] Update all file paths to match the DDD structure
- [x] Correct component names to match current implementations
- [x] Update architecture.mmd with accurate layers and relationships

## Phase 4: Content Enhancement

### Task 4.1: Create Workflow Documentation
- [x] Document user onboarding and first challenge workflow
- [x] Document challenge lifecycle (creation to evaluation)
- [x] Add sequence diagrams for critical flows

### Task 4.2: Add Architectural Decision Records
- [x] Create 001-ddd-adoption.md explaining why DDD was chosen
- [x] Create 002-responses-api.md explaining the move to Responses API
- [x] Create 003-event-system.md documenting event system design decisions

### Task 4.3: Improve Diagrams and Visualizations
- [x] Update architecture.mmd with accurate components
- [x] Add component diagrams for complex domains
- [x] Create sequence diagrams for key workflows

## Phase 5: Review and Finalization

### Task 5.1: Documentation Quality Check
- [x] Review all documents for consistency in style and terminology
- [x] Verify all internal links are working
- [x] Check that all code examples are correct and functional
- [x] Ensure all diagrams are accurate and up-to-date

### Task 5.2: Documentation Completeness Check
