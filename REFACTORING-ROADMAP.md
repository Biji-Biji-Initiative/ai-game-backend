# API Admin Refactoring Roadmap

This document outlines the remaining tasks to complete the architectural refactoring of the API Admin application.

## Immediate Tasks (Phase 2 Completion)

### 1. Fix Remaining Type Mismatches
- [x] Resolve module import mismatches in AppBootstrapper.ts
- [x] Fix EndpointManagerOptions compatibility issues
- [x] Resolve UserFriendlyFlowManagerOptions and UserFriendlyUIOptions mismatches
- [x] Update the ResponseViewer and DomainStateViewer constructors

### 2. Complete Controller Refactoring
- [ ] Refactor ResponseController to use abstractions
- [ ] Refactor UserInterfaceController to use DOM abstractions
- [ ] Ensure all controllers use the dependency container
- [ ] Fix any circular dependencies between controllers

### 3. Abstract Browser-Specific Logic
- [x] Finish StorageService implementations
- [x] Complete DomService implementation
- [x] Create a NetworkService for fetch/XMLHttpRequest operations
- [x] Create a LoggingService to abstract console logging

### 4. Clean Up Old Code
- [x] Run cleanup-old-implementations.sh script
- [x] Verify application functionality after cleanup
- [x] Remove duplicate implementations
- [ ] Fix any broken references

## Short-term Tasks (Phase 3)

### 1. Implement Code Splitting
- [ ] Configure webpack/esbuild for code splitting
- [ ] Define entry points for different application modules
- [ ] Optimize bundle size
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for non-critical components

### 2. Test Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up Jest or another testing framework
- [ ] Create mock implementations of service interfaces
- [ ] Write unit tests for core services 
- [ ] Write unit tests for controllers
- [ ] Set up coverage reporting

### 3. Continuous Integration
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions or CI pipeline
- [ ] Automate testing on pull requests
- [ ] Configure linting checks
- [ ] Set up automatic deployment

## Long-term Improvements

### 1. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement virtualization for large data lists
- [ ] Add request caching
- [ ] Optimize DOM updates
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

### 2. Enhanced Documentation
- [ ] Generate API documentation from code
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams
- [ ] Implement a component catalog
- [ ] Document extension patterns

### 3. Feature Enhancements
- [ ] Add collaboration features
- [ ] Improve flow visualization
- [ ] Add template library
- [ ] Implement advanced variable extraction
- [ ] Add integration with external tools

## Definition of Done

The refactoring will be considered complete when:

1. All controllers use the dependency container for services
2. Direct DOM manipulation has been abstracted away
3. All localStorage/sessionStorage access uses StorageService
4. There are no TypeScript errors or linter warnings
5. Unit tests cover >80% of the codebase
6. The application functions identically to before refactoring
7. Code follows established patterns and conventions
