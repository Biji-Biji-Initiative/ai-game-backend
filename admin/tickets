Okay, let's refine the plan to make the api-tester-ui a truly powerful tool for understanding your backend's behavior, especially the AI interactions and domain logic flow, while also adding helpful status indicators. We'll keep it focused on being a developer/testing tool and leverage the existing backend structure where possible.

Vision for the Enhanced API Tester UI:

The goal is to transform the UI from just an endpoint caller into an interactive debugger and visualizer for your DDD application flows. It should help you:

Trace Requests: See the flow of a request from the UI call through the backend, including key internal steps.
Inspect AI Interactions: Clearly view the exact prompts sent to OpenAI and the raw responses received.
Observe Domain Events: Visualize the domain events triggered by specific actions.
Monitor Backend Health: Get a quick overview of the backend's status and dependencies.
Manage Test Context: Easily pass data between related API calls within a test flow.
Improvements & Rationale:

Visualizing Interactions (AI & Events): The key is correlating frontend actions with backend logs. The previous tickets TESTER-4 (Enhance Backend Logging) and TESTER-5 (Add Backend Log Fetching) are essential foundations. We'll build specific UI components on top of this.
System Health Indicators: Yes, adding indicators is crucial for knowing if the backend you're testing against is in a healthy state (DB connected, AI service reachable). This isn't full production monitoring but gives confidence during testing.
Usability: Features like context passing (TESTER-3) and better response rendering (TESTER-2) remain important for making the tool efficient.
Refined JIRA Tickets for Enhanced UI:

(Building upon the previously implemented/suggested tickets)

Ticket: TESTER-UI-1: Implement AI Interaction Visualization
Type: Feature / UI Enhancement
Priority: Highest
Description: Enhance the ResponseViewer and Log Panel. When backend logs (fetched via TESTER-5) associated with the current request's correlationId contain specific log entries for AI prompts and responses (as implemented in TESTER-4), display this information clearly.
Add a dedicated "AI Interaction" tab to the ResponseViewer.
In this tab, display:
The formatted prompt text sent to the AI.
The system message/instructions sent.
The raw JSON response received from the AI.
Provide syntax highlighting for the prompt and response.
Allow easy copying of the prompt and response.
Alternatively or additionally, highlight/filter these specific AI logs within the "Backend Logs" tab.
Dependencies: TESTER-4, TESTER-5 (Backend logging and log fetching).
Benefit: Direct visibility into the crucial AI communication layer for debugging prompts and responses.
Acceptance Criteria: UI clearly displays prompts sent to AI and raw responses received, linked to the relevant API request. Content is easily readable and copyable.
Ticket: TESTER-UI-2: Visualize Domain Events in Logs
Type: Feature / UI Enhancement
Priority: High
Description: Enhance the backend log display (TESTER-5). When backend logs contain entries indicating a domain event was published (assuming backend logs this clearly, tagged with the correlationId), visually distinguish these log entries.
Add a specific style or icon to log entries representing domain events.
Display the event type (e.g., USER_CREATED) and key payload data clearly.
Consider adding a filter option specifically for "Domain Events" in the backend logs tab.
Dependencies: TESTER-5, Backend logging needs to clearly log published events with correlation IDs.
Benefit: Allows developers to see the sequence of domain events triggered by an API call, crucial for understanding DDD workflows and side effects.
Acceptance Criteria: Domain events logged on the backend are easily identifiable and inspectable within the UI's backend log viewer, linked to the originating request.
Ticket: TESTER-UI-3: Implement System Status Indicator Panel
Type: Feature / UI Enhancement
Priority: Medium
Description: Add a small, persistent panel or indicator section in the UI (e.g., in the header or footer) that displays the overall health status fetched from the backend's /api/v1/health endpoint.
Fetch health status periodically (e.g., every 30 seconds) or on manual trigger.
Display overall status (Healthy/Unhealthy/Degraded) with a clear visual indicator (e.g., green/red/yellow dot).
Optionally, allow clicking the indicator to show a modal with detailed dependency statuses (DB, OpenAI) as returned by the health endpoint.
Clearly indicate the backend environment (Dev/Prod/Test) being targeted.
Benefit: Provides immediate feedback on the backend's operational status during testing. Helps differentiate backend issues from UI/request issues.
Acceptance Criteria: UI displays a clear, updating indicator of the backend health status. Detailed dependency status is accessible. Backend environment is clearly shown.
Ticket: TESTER-UI-4: Enhance Variable Management & Usage
Type: Improvement / UI Enhancement
Priority: Medium
Description: Improve the variable extraction and usage (TESTER-3) feature.
In the VariableExtractor UI, provide visual feedback or validation when entering JSONPaths against the current response.
In the main request form (URL, Headers, Body), visually indicate where variables ({{variableName}}) are being used.
Consider adding an "auto-fill" option where common variables (like {{userId}}, {{challengeId}}) from the previous step's context are automatically suggested or populated in the next step's form.
Display the current set of defined variables persistently in a dedicated panel (similar to Postman environments/globals).
Dependencies: TESTER-3 (Base variable extraction/usage).
Benefit: Makes context passing between steps smoother and more transparent, reducing errors and speeding up testing flows.
Acceptance Criteria: Variable usage is clearer in the request form. Extracting variables is more interactive. Variables are easily viewable. Auto-filling common patterns improves workflow.
Ticket: TESTER-UI-5: Improve Response Viewer Interactivity
Type: Improvement / UI Enhancement
Priority: Low
Description: Enhance the ResponseViewer (building on TESTER-2).
Implement collapsing/expanding sections for large JSON/XML.
Add search functionality within the Formatted/Raw response tabs.
Ensure better rendering performance for very large responses (consider virtualization or incremental rendering).
Dependencies: TESTER-2 (Base ResponseViewer enhancements).
Benefit: Improves the usability of inspecting large or complex API responses.
Acceptance Criteria: Large responses are easier to navigate and search within the UI. Performance remains acceptable even with large data.
Summary of Approach:

This set of tickets focuses on leveraging the information available (either directly via API responses or indirectly via backend logs correlated by ID) and presenting it effectively within the UI.

TESTER-UI-1 & TESTER-UI-2: Directly address the need to visualize AI interactions and domain events by enhancing the log viewer. This requires good backend logging practices (Ticket TESTER-4) and the log fetching mechanism (TESTER-5).
TESTER-UI-3: Provides the desired health/status indicators by consuming the existing backend health check.
TESTER-UI-4: Makes the previously implemented context passing (TESTER-3) more usable and visible.
TESTER-UI-5: Generally improves the experience of working with responses.
This approach avoids significant backend re-architecture for the tester's sake but relies on the backend providing the necessary observability through logging and potentially dedicated tester endpoints. It keeps the tester focused on visualizing and interacting with the existing system behavior.
