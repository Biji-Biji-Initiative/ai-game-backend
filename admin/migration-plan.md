# Migration Plan: Transitioning from main.ts to Modular Architecture

## Current Status

We've successfully implemented several key TypeScript modules:

- ✅ `AppController`: Main controller that orchestrates all modules
- ✅ `EndpointManager`: Manages API endpoints
- ✅ `BackendLogsManager`: Handles backend logs
- ✅ `StatusManager`: Monitors API status
- ✅ `VariableManager`: Manages variables across requests
- ✅ `FlowController`: Manages API flows and steps
- ✅ `Config`: Handles application configuration
- ✅ Interfaces: Defined proper TypeScript interfaces for all modules

The application initialization is now handled by `index.ts` which initializes the `AppController`.

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. UI Components (High Priority)

- [ ] Complete `ResponseViewer.ts`: Migrate from `displayJsonResult()` in main.ts
- [ ] Complete `VariableExtractor.ts`: Migrate from variable handling code in main.ts
- [ ] Refactor `showResult()` functionality into `ResponseViewer`
- [ ] Implement proper UI event handling in `UIManager`

### 2. Legacy Code Removal (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Identify portions of `main.ts` that have been migrated
- [ ] Create checklist of remaining functionality to migrate
- [ ] Remove duplicated code once migration is complete
- [ ] Update imports to use proper TypeScript modules

### 3. Utility Functions (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Move all utility functions from `main.ts` to appropriate utility modules:
  - [ ] `formatJSON()` → `utils/format-utils.ts`
  - [ ] `escapeHtml()` → `utils/string-utils.ts`
  - [ ] `determineTokenType()` → `utils/json-utils.ts`
  - [ ] `generateExampleFromSchema()` → `utils/schema-utils.ts`

### 4. Error Handling (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Implement centralized error handling in `AppController`
- [ ] Migrate `showError()` functionality to appropriate components
- [ ] Add proper error type definitions

### 5. Testing (Low Priority)

- [ ] Add unit tests for utility functions
- [ ] Add integration tests for main modules
- [ ] Create test fixtures and mock data

### 6. Documentation (Low Priority)

- [ ] Document all public interfaces
- [ ] Add comments to complex functionality
- [ ] Create usage examples for each module

## Migration Strategy

1. **Module-by-Module Approach**
   - Focus on one module at a time
   - Test each module independently
   - Integrate with the main application

2. **UI Component Migration**
   - Keep the existing UI working while migrating
   - Build new UI components alongside existing code
   - Switch to new components when ready

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Use dependency injection for all modules
   - Avoid global state and singletons where possible
   - Prefer constructor injection over service locator pattern

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Add tests for each migrated module
   - Ensure backward compatibility
   - Validate functionality against existing behavior

## Timeline

1. **Phase 1: Complete UI Components (Week 1)**
   - Finish `ResponseViewer`
   - Finish `VariableExtractor`
   - Complete `UIManager` event handling

2. **Phase 2: Migrate Utility Functions (Week 1-2)**
   - Move all utility functions to dedicated modules
   - Update imports in dependent modules

3. **Phase 3: Error Handling (Week 2)**
   - Implement centralized error handling
   - Update error reporting in all modules

4. **Phase 4: Testing & Documentation (Week 3)**
   - Add unit tests
   - Document public interfaces
   - Create usage examples

5. **Phase 5: Cleanup (Week 3-4)**
   - Remove duplicate code
   - Delete `main.ts` if everything has been migrated
   - Final QA testing

## Conclusion

This migration represents a significant improvement in code structure, maintainability, and type safety. By moving from a monolithic `main.ts` file to a modular architecture with proper TypeScript typing, we'll achieve:

- Better code organization
- Improved maintainability
- Enhanced type safety
- Easier testing
- Better developer experience

The incremental approach outlined in this plan ensures that we can maintain functionality throughout the migration process while systematically improving the codebase.
