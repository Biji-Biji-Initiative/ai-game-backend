# Ticket #11: Register responsesApiClient in DI Container

## Summary

This ticket addressed an issue with the `evaluationService` registration in the dependency injection container. The service was meant to use the `responsesApiClient` but there was a gap in the DI configuration. The client was already registered in the container but not being properly injected into the service.

## Problem Analysis

Upon investigation, I found:

1. The `responsesApiClient` was already correctly registered in the DI container in `src/config/container/infrastructure.js`:
   ```javascript
   container.register(
     'responsesApiClient',
     _c => {
       return require('../../core/infra/api/responsesApiClient');
     },
     true // Singleton: YES - thin wrapper around OpenAIClient
   );
   ```

2. The `evaluationService` registration in `src/config/container/services.js` was missing the `responsesApiClient` dependency:
   ```javascript
   container.register(
     'evaluationService',
     c => {
       const EvaluationService = require('../../core/evaluation/services/evaluationService');
       return new EvaluationService({
         evaluationRepository: c.get('evaluationRepository'),
         evaluationCategoryRepository: c.get('evaluationCategoryRepository'),
         logger: c.get('evaluationLogger'),
         eventBus: c.get('eventBus'),
       });
     },
     true
   );
   ```

3. The `EvaluationService` implementation has been significantly simplified compared to the original version, which can be found in `evaluationService.js.original`. The original version did explicitly use `responsesApiClient` for API calls.

## Changes Made

Updated the `evaluationService` registration in `src/config/container/services.js` to properly inject both the `responsesApiClient` and `openAIStateManager` dependencies:

```javascript
container.register(
  'evaluationService',
  c => {
    const EvaluationService = require('../../core/evaluation/services/evaluationService');
    return new EvaluationService({
      evaluationRepository: c.get('evaluationRepository'),
      evaluationCategoryRepository: c.get('evaluationCategoryRepository'),
      responsesApiClient: c.get('responsesApiClient'),
      openAIStateManager: c.get('openAIStateManager'),
      logger: c.get('evaluationLogger'),
      eventBus: c.get('eventBus'),
    });
  },
  true
);
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Dependency Management**: All dependencies are now properly managed through the DI container.

2. **Better Testability**: Services that correctly use DI are easier to test, as dependencies can be mocked.

3. **Consistent Architecture**: The application now follows a consistent pattern for service instantiation.

4. **Future-proofing**: If the service implementation is restored to use these dependencies, it will already have the necessary injections.

## Notes

1. The actual `EvaluationService` implementation appears to be a simplified version that may not currently use the `responsesApiClient` or `openAIStateManager`, but injecting these dependencies ensures the service will work if the original functionality is restored.

2. The `responsesApiClient` is marked as deprecated in its implementation with a note to use the `OpenAIClient` directly. In a future refactoring, it might be worth updating all services to use `OpenAIClient` directly rather than going through this compatibility layer.
