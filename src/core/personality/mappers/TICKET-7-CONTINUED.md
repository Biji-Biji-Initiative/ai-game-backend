# Ticket #7: Ensure Data Mapper Pattern Consistency (Continued)

## Additional Changes for Personality Domain

We've extended the Data Mapper pattern implementation to the Personality domain, continuing our work to separate domain models from persistence concerns. The following changes were made:

1. **Created PersonalityMapper.js**
   - Implemented methods to convert between domain and persistence formats:
     - `toPersistence`: Converts Personality domain entities to database format with validation
     - `toDomain`: Converts database data to Personality domain entities
     - `toDomainCollection`: Converts database collections to domain entity collections

2. **Removed Persistence Logic from Personality Model**
   - Deleted the `toDatabase()` method from Personality.js
   - Domain entity now focuses purely on business logic, not persistence concerns

3. **Updated PersonalityRepository to Use Mapper**
   - Added mapper import and integration
   - Modified save method to use `personalityMapper.toPersistence()` instead of `personality.toDatabase()`
   - Improved imports to properly include all required dependencies

4. **Maintained Schema Validation**
   - Kept schema validation in the mapper to ensure data integrity
   - Used existing personalityDatabaseSchema for validation before persistence

## Note on Linter Errors

During implementation, we encountered linter errors related to `await` expressions being used outside of async functions. These appear to be pre-existing issues in the PersonalityRepository.js file that were not introduced by our changes. A separate ticket should be created to address these async/await issues more comprehensively (which aligns with Ticket #13: Review and Fix Async/Await Usage).

## Next Steps

To fully implement the Data Mapper pattern consistently across the codebase:

1. Review ChallengeCoordinator.js which still directly calls toDatabase() on Challenge instances
2. Check all remaining domain models for toDatabase() methods
3. Consider creating a central guideline document explaining the Data Mapper pattern for future development
