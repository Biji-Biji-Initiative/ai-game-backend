# Ticket 13 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented the UserDTO and UserDTOMapper classes to properly decouple the User domain model from its API representation.

## Changes Made

### 1. UserDTO Class Implementation
Created a UserDTO class that represents the data structure exposed via the User API endpoints:
- Included all necessary fields from the User domain model
- Added computed properties useful for API consumers:
  - `isActive`: Boolean indicating if the user status is active
  - `hasCompletedProfile`: Boolean indicating if the user has a complete profile
- Implemented proper toJSON method for serialization

### 2. UserDTOMapper Implementation
Implemented the UserDTOMapper with three key static methods:
- `toDTO(user)`: Converts a User domain entity to a UserDTO
  - Handles both camelCase and snake_case property names for flexibility
  - Properly transforms domain properties into API-friendly format
  - Returns null for null input
- `toDTOCollection(users)`: Converts an array of User entities to DTOs
  - Handles empty arrays and non-array inputs gracefully
- `fromRequest(requestBody)`: Processes API request bodies for domain operations
  - Sanitizes inputs (trims strings, lowercases emails)
  - Supports different input formats (firstName/lastName vs fullName)
  - Validates status values against allowed options
  - Returns clean object with only valid properties

### 3. Verification
The UserController was already using the UserDTOMapper correctly:
- Using `UserDTOMapper.toDTO` before sending user data in responses
- Using `UserDTOMapper.toDTOCollection` for list endpoints
- Using `UserDTOMapper.fromRequest` to process incoming request bodies

## Benefits

1. **Clear API Contract**: The UserDTO provides a stable API contract that can evolve independently of the domain model
2. **Data Transformation Logic**: Centralizes transformation logic in one place
3. **Input Validation**: Provides a clear place for input validation and sanitization
4. **Computed Properties**: Allows computing additional properties specific to API needs
5. **Domain Protection**: Prevents exposing internal domain properties to API consumers

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding schema validation in the fromRequest method
2. Potentially implement field selection/filtering for different API endpoints
3. Add versioning support if the API contract needs to evolve

## Conclusion
The implementation successfully completes the acceptance criteria by decoupling the domain model from its API representation. This pattern can be applied to other domains in the system for consistent API design.
