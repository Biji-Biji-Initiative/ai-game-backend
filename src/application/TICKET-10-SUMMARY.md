# Ticket 10 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implement proper inheritance from BaseCoordinator and refactor coordinators to use services instead of repositories.

## Changes Made

1. **UserJourneyCoordinator Refactoring**
   - Removed direct dependency on userJourneyRepository
   - Updated constructor parameters and validation
   - Modified methods to use userJourneyService instead of direct repository access
   - Improved code maintainability through this service abstraction

2. **UserJourneyService Implementation**
   - Transformed from a collection of exported functions to a proper class
   - Added methods to encapsulate repository access:
     - recordEvent
     - getUserEvents
     - getUserEventsByType
     - getUserEventCountsByType
   - Implemented proper error handling
   - Maintained all business logic functions that were previously exposed

3. **DI Container Updates**
   - Modified UserJourneyCoordinator registration to remove userJourneyRepository dependency
   - Ensured ProgressCoordinator uses userService (was already implemented)

4. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Better enforcement of separation of concerns between layers
   - Improved adherence to DDD principles with clear boundaries between application and domain layers
   - Enhanced code maintainability by reducing direct repository dependencies
   - Proper use of inheritance from BaseCoordinator for standardized error handling and logging

## Benefits

- **Cleaner Architecture**: Application layer (coordinators) now properly orchestrates domain services rather than directly using repositories
- **Better Testability**: Services can be easily mocked in tests for coordinators
- **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to data access logic can be made in one place (the service) rather than in multiple coordinators
- **Enhanced Reusability**: Service methods can be reused across multiple coordinators or other services

## Verification

- Verified that UserJourneyCoordinator works with the new service-based approach
- Confirmed ProgressCoordinator was already refactored to use userService instead of userRepository
- Ensured all required functionality was maintained during the refactoring
