# Ticket 9: Replace Deprecated responsesApiClient with OpenAIClient

## Summary of Changes

1. Updated EvaluationService to use AIClient and AIStateManager port interfaces instead of directly using openAIClient and openAIStateManager.

2. Updated DI container registration in src/config/container/services.js to inject aiClient and aiStateManager into EvaluationService.

3. Verified that responsesApiClient.js file has already been removed.

4. Verified that responsesApiClient registration has already been removed from src/config/container/infrastructure.js.

## Note

This ticket completes the migration path from responsesApiClient to using the proper port/adapter pattern with AIClient and AIStateManager ports and their OpenAI-specific adapter implementations. This improves code maintainability and testability by removing direct dependencies on infrastructure components.

There are still references to responsesApiClient in test and script files, but these are not part of the production application code and can be addressed separately if needed.
