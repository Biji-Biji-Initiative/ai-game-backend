# ES Modules Migration Summary

## Problem Statement

Our codebase is using CommonJS modules, but ESLint v9 and modern JavaScript practices favor ES Modules. We need to migrate our codebase to use ES Modules to take advantage of tree-shaking, better static analysis, and to ensure compatibility with modern tooling.

## Current Status

- **CommonJS Usage**: 776 require statements, 239 module.exports statements
- **ES Modules Usage**: 13 import statements, 3 export statements
- **Codebase Size**: Large, with numerous files and dependencies
- **Key Dependencies**: Express, Supabase, OpenAI, Winston

## Work Done So Far

1. **Analysis**: Counted the number of CommonJS and ES Module statements in the codebase
2. **Migration Script**: Created `scripts/utils/esm-migration-plan.js` to assist with the migration
3. **Sample Migration**: Converted `src/core/infra/cache/cacheFactory.js` to `src/core/infra/cache/cacheFactory.mjs`
4. **Documentation**: Created a comprehensive migration guide in `docs/esm-migration-guide.md`
5. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Created a new ESLint config using the new format in `eslint.config.js`
   - Updated package.json.esm to include the type:module setting

## Migration Strategy

We're taking an incremental approach to minimize disruption:

1. **Phase 1 - Analysis and Setup**:
   - ✓ Identify CommonJS vs. ES Modules usage
   - ✓ Create ESLint configuration that supports both during transition
   - ✓ Establish migration tools and processes
   - ✓ Create sample of migrated file

2. **Phase 2 - Incremental Migration**:
   - Start with utility files that have few dependencies
   - Move to core services
   - Update entry points last
   - Add new files as ES Modules by default

3. **Phase 3 - Testing and Finalization**:
   - Test extensively throughout the migration
   - Update documentation
   - Finalize configuration

## Next Steps

1. Run the migration analysis script to identify good candidate files to migrate first
2. Create a list of "leaf node" files that can be easily converted
3. Begin converting files in small batches and verify functionality
4. Update the README.md with migration progress
5. Consider setting up a CI test that ensures both CommonJS and ES Modules versions work correctly during the transition

## Migration Challenges

- **Dynamic Imports**: Will need special handling for dynamic imports
- **__dirname and __filename**: These globals don't exist in ES Modules
- **Circular Dependencies**: May be revealed during migration
- **Testing Framework Compatibility**: Jest configuration may need updates
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Some may not fully support ES Modules
