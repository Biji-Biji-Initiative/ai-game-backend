# Integration Test Fixes

## What We've Done

1. **Consolidated Tests**: 
   - Moved all workflow and integration tests from domain directories to `tests/integration/workflows/`
   - Organized tests by domain area: challenge, evaluation, user, personality

2. **Fixed Environment Setup**:
   - Created a `util` directory for shared test utilities
   - Copied `loadEnv.js` to make it accessible to workflow tests
   - Created a simplified `testHelpers.js` with essential test utilities

3. **Fixed Common Errors**:
   - Resolved Jest vs. Mocha compatibility issues
   - Fixed import paths for moved files
   - Updated timeout configuration for tests
   - Fixed field name issues in database tests

4. **Created Simple Example**:
   - Added `simple-workflow-test.js` to demonstrate the test infrastructure
   - Covered basic assertions, async operations, and timeout handling

5. **Enhanced Documentation**:
   - Updated README with clear instructions
   - Documented test organization and naming conventions
   - Added examples for running specific test categories

6. **Created Run Script**:
   - Created `run_workflow_tests.sh` script for easy test execution
   - Configured to run the most reliable tests by default

## Next Steps

1. **Fix External Dependencies**:
   - The Supabase integration tests need proper authentication setup
   - Database schema needs to match test expectations

2. **Standardize Test Patterns**:
   - Update remaining tests to follow consistent patterns
   - Ensure proper error handling and cleanup in all tests

3. **Improve Test Isolation**:
   - Ensure tests don't interfere with each other
   - Use proper before/after hooks for setup and teardown

4. **Consider Mock Implementations**:
   - For tests with external dependencies, provide mock alternatives
   - Separate unit tests (which can use mocks) from true integration tests
