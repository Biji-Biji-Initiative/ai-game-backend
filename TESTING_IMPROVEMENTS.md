# Testing Infrastructure Improvements

## Summary of Accomplishments

We've made significant improvements to the testing infrastructure to better support Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and enable more effective testing of the codebase. The main accomplishments include:

1. **Fixed Import Path Issues**
   - Created a script `scripts/fix-test-imports.js` to automatically fix import paths in test files
   - Fixed relative paths to ensure correct imports across the test hierarchy
   - Resolved critical import path issues in the evaluation and prompt domains

2. **Created Comprehensive Mocking Infrastructure**
   - Implemented `tests/setup/mockSetup.js` for standardized test setup
   - Created `tests/helpers/mockSupabaseClient.js` for consistent Supabase mocking
   - Developed factories in `tests/helpers/testFactory.js` for test data generation

3. **Implemented Modern Testing Patterns**
   - Converted Jest-style tests to use Chai and Sinon for better integration
   - Added proper dependency injection patterns for better testability
   - Fixed asynchronous test patterns to avoid timing issues and race conditions

4. **Analysis and Organization Tools**
   - Created `scripts/analyze-test-placement.js` to detect misplaced tests
   - Developed `scripts/run-domain-tests.js` to run domain tests without external dependencies
   - Created `scripts/run-passing-tests.js` to run reliable tests during refactoring

5. **Documentation and Best Practices**
   - Added comprehensive test documentation in `tests/README.md`
   - Documented mocking patterns and testing conventions
   - Created guides for adding new tests and organizing existing ones

## Currently Working Tests

We've successfully fixed and verified the following tests:

1. `tests/domain/adaptive/schemas/adaptiveSchemas.test.js` - All 11 tests pass
2. `tests/domain/evaluation/services/serviceDynamicSystemMessages.test.js` - All 5 tests pass
3. `tests/domain/user/models/User.test.js` - All 22 tests pass

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Remaining Domain Tests**
   - Address validation issues in repository tests
   - Fix dependency issues in service tests
   - Complete remaining import path fixes

2. **Enhance Test Coverage**
   - Add more domain tests for core logic
   - Improve mocking for OpenAI integrations
   - Create additional test helpers for common patterns

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Run test analysis regularly to ensure proper test organization
   - Convert any remaining Jest tests to Chai/Sinon
   - Maintain documentation and testing conventions
