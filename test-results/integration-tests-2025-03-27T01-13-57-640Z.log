After some thought, you realize each symbol corresponds to a number based on its angles: Circle (0), Triangle (3), Square (4), Star (5). Your task is to find the pattern in the sequence and predict the next symbol that should follow according to the aliens' logic. Can you determine the next symbol in the sequence?\n" +

Each subsequent symbol is determined by the sum of the values (modulo 6) of the previous two symbols. Good luck, and the fate of first contact may depend on your solution!'
