Each night, the lighthouses follow a specific sequence: the red lighthouse turns on first, followed by the blue, then the green, and finally the yellow. However, on some nights, one lighthouse stays on longer than the others, disrupting the usual sequence. You have a notebook where you can record observations, and you must figure out which lighthouse is staying on longer, and why. Use your logical reasoning skills to identify patterns and solve the mystery of the extended light.'

      description: "Imagine you are part of a team developing AI for an autonomous vehicle. Your team's project is nearing completion, but you've encountered a significant ethical dilemma: the vehicle must make decisions in potentially dangerous scenarios, such as a sudden obstacle appearing in the road. One team member suggests that the vehicle should prioritize the safety of pedestrians over passengers at all times, while another argues that the passengers' safety should come first since they are the ones using the vehicle's service. Your task is to propose a balanced decision-making framework for the autonomous vehicle that addresses this ethical dilemma, ensuring fairness and minimizing harm. Consider factors such as legal responsibility, public acceptance, and moral philosophies in your framework."
