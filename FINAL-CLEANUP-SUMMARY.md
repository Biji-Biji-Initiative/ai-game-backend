# Final Monorepo Cleanup Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Removed redundant dependencies from individual packages
   - Centralized common dependencies in the root package.json
   - Fixed workspace references to use `workspace:*` format
   - Added missing dependencies (node-cache)
   - Updated all packages to their latest versions
   - Set Node.js to version >=23.0.0

2. **Configuration Updates**
   - Changed API port from 3001 to 3002 to prevent conflicts
   - Updated express-rate-limit to use modern handler approach
   - Fixed deprecation warnings
   - Updated Sentry packages to latest versions

3. **Process Management**
   - **Standardized on PM2** for all process management
   - Created comprehensive PM2 configuration with fixed ports
   - Added clear process naming and grouping for readability
   - Implemented proper log rotation and monitoring
   - Created user-friendly scripts for common PM2 operations

4. **Monorepo Structure**
   - Standardized on pnpm for package management
   - Configured proper hoisting behavior
   - Added utility scripts for maintenance

## Key Benefits

1. **Latest Dependencies**: All packages updated to their most recent versions
2. **Standardized Process Management**: PM2 manages all processes with consistent configuration
3. **Fixed Ports**: All services use consistent, non-conflicting ports
4. **Simplified Commands**: User-friendly npm/pnpm scripts abstract PM2 complexity
5. **Better Monitoring**: Built-in logging and monitoring for all services
6. **Production Ready**: Cluster mode for production with automatic load balancing

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Getting Started**:
   - Run `./setup-pm2.sh` to set up the PM2 environment
   - Use `pnpm dev` to start the development environment
   - Check status with `pnpm status`

2. **Common Commands**:
   - Development: `pnpm dev`
   - Production: `pnpm start`
   - Stop all: `pnpm stop`
   - Check status: `pnpm status`
   - View logs: `pnpm logs`
   - Monitor: `pnpm monitor`

3. **Accessing Services**:
   - API: http://localhost:3002/api/v1
   - API Docs: http://localhost:3002/api-docs
   - UI Tester (Dev): http://localhost:5173
   - UI Tester (Prod): http://localhost:5000

## Next Steps

1. Configure automatic deploys with PM2 deployment feature
2. Add monitoring and alerting integration
3. Consider containerization for more consistent environments
