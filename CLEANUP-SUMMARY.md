# Monorepo Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Standardized on pnpm**
   - Removed npm workspace configuration
   - Configured proper pnpm workspace setup in pnpm-workspace.yaml
   - Updated .npmrc with optimal settings

2. **Fixed Package References**
   - Changed all internal package references from `file:../package` to `workspace:*`
   - This follows pnpm best practices and provides better isolation

3. **Consolidated Configuration Files**
   - Removed duplicate package.json files (package.json.esm, monorepo-package.json)
   - Merged useful scripts from multiple files into a single root package.json

4. **Created Utility Scripts**
   - `validate-deps.sh`: Checks for proper dependency management across packages
   - `cleanup-monorepo.sh`: Cleans up node_modules and other temporary files
   - `setup.sh`: Single script to set up the entire monorepo

5. **Documented Structure and Practices**
   - Added comprehensive MONOREPO.md documentation
   - Added clear instructions for adding dependencies
   - Added troubleshooting guides

## Remaining Duplication Warnings

The validation script shows warnings for duplicate dependencies between the root and packages. This is expected behavior:

- Root dependencies are shared across all packages
- Package-specific dependencies should remain in their respective package.json files
- These warnings don't indicate a problem but show opportunities for further optimization

## Next Steps

1. **Consider Moving More Dependencies to Root**
   - Dependencies used by multiple packages should be in the root package.json
   - Package-specific dependencies should remain in their respective package.json files

2. **Standardize Node.js Version**
   - Update the .nvmrc file to match the version in package.json
   - Consider using the same Node.js version across all environments

3. **Run Standard Startup**
   - Use `./setup.sh` to ensure everything is properly installed
   - Run `pnpm dev:api` to start the API server

4. **Maintain Package Hygiene**
   - Run `./validate-deps.sh` regularly to check for potential issues
   - Use `./cleanup-monorepo.sh` if you encounter dependency problems
