Tech Notes: Requires extending userService mock endpoints.
Priority: Medium (Feature Enhancement).
Ticket FE-30: Address Hardcoded Challenge IDs
Description: Refactor Round2.tsx and Round3.tsx. Instead of using hardcoded challenge IDs ('challenge-1', 'challenge-3'), retrieve the actual challenge ID from the useGameStore state (which should be populated when the challenge for that round is generated/loaded). Pass this dynamic ID to useGetAIResponse and useSubmitResponse.
Acceptance Criteria: Round2 and Round3 use dynamic challenge IDs from the game state for API calls.
Priority: Medium (Bug Fix/Refinement).
This covers the next 20 tickets, pushing towards a more dynamic, personalized, and engaging application, while still working within the frontend mock constraints.



Okay, let's plan the next set of 10 tickets, focusing on adding more depth to the user experience, leveraging more of the simulated API capabilities, and refining existing features.

Acceptance Criteria: AI thinking visualizer appears during simulated processing times for challenge generation, AI response fetching, and profile generation.
Tech Notes: Import and use AIActivityVisualizer.tsx in Round1.tsx, Round2.tsx, Round3.tsx, potentially ResultsProfile.tsx loading state. Check isLoading state from React Query hooks.
Priority: Medium (UX/Immersion).
Ticket FE-39: Refine Loading States
Description: Review all pages/components that fetch data (Trait Assessment, Focus Selection, Rounds, Results, Dashboard, Challenge Browser). Ensure consistent and clear loading states are shown using LoadingSpinner or skeletons while data is being fetched via useQuery or useMutation is pending. Replace generic "Loading..." text where appropriate.
Acceptance Criteria: All data-fetching components display appropriate loading indicators (LoadingSpinner or Shadcn Skeleton). Users clearly see when content is loading.
Priority: Medium (UX Polish).
Ticket FE-40: Refine Error Handling
Description: Review all components using useQuery or useMutation. Ensure API errors are caught and displayed gracefully to the user, potentially using the ApiError component or Shadcn Alert components. Provide options to retry where applicable.
Acceptance Criteria: API errors in major flows (assessment, focus, rounds, results, dashboard) are handled and displayed clearly. Retry options are available where appropriate.
Priority: Medium (Robustness/UX).
This next batch focuses on fleshing out the experience by adding features like challenge browsing, adaptive recommendations (simulated), basic profile editing, and enhancing the dashboard with more progress/personality details, while also polishing the loading/error states and adding the AI visualizer for better immersion.



Okay, here are the next 10 tickets, focusing on adding more depth, gamification elements (simulated), UI polish, and utilizing more of the data structures defined in your API/prompts.

Sprint 5: Deeper Engagement & Polish (Tickets 41-50)

Ticket FE-41: Implement Mock Leaderboard Display

Acceptance Criteria: Dashboard and Results pages provide a clean and usable experience on mobile viewports (e.g., 360px width). No content overflow or usability issues.
Priority: Medium (UX Polish).
Ticket FE-50: Create Basic Mock Admin Page Structure (User List)
Description: Create a basic structure for mock admin functionality. Add a route like /admin/users. Create a simple page that uses a mock userService hook (useGetUsers - needs creation) to fetch the list of mockUsers and displays them using DataTable. (No actual admin functionality needed, just the UI structure). Add a basic "Admin" link somewhere (e.g., footer) accessible only in development mode.
Acceptance Criteria: /admin/users route exists. Page fetches and displays mock users in a table. Link is visible only in dev mode.
Priority: Low (Dev Tool/Future Proofing).
This batch adds layers of engagement through simulated gamification and adaptivity, polishes the UI and accessibility, and starts structuring potential future areas like admin views.






Okay, we've outlined 50 tickets covering a significantly enhanced, personalized initial game flow, a richer results page, basic post-play engagement features (dashboard, adaptive challenge), and essential code cleanup/polish.

Are we "done"?

For a Major Enhancement Phase: Yes, those 50 tickets represent a very substantial body of work that would dramatically improve the frontend compared to its current state. Completing these would deliver on the goal of a more personalized, engaging, and data-rich experience, leveraging much more of the potential outlined in your API specs and prompts (within the mock frontend context).
For Implementing Everything Possible: No. As identified in the thought process, your API spec hints at even more features (full admin panels, detailed history filtering, AI agent management, real auth flows, etc.) that haven't been explicitly ticketed.
Should we do all the remaining tickets left?

My recommendation is to focus on the 50 tickets outlined so far. This represents a cohesive and significant enhancement focused on the core user experience and engagement loop.

Trying to ticket everything else right now might:

Create too much noise: It could obscure the priority of delivering the core personalized experience.
Include Out-of-Scope Items: Full admin panels or real authentication flows might not be relevant for this specific phase, especially given the "purely frontend mock implementation" constraint.
Require More Context: Some features (like AI Agent interactions or detailed User Journey filtering) might benefit from seeing the core enhancements implemented first to better understand how they should integrate.
Proposed Next Step:

Let's consider the 50 tickets as the current defined scope for making the frontend awesome. Once those are significantly underway or completed, we can revisit the remaining API capabilities and decide which additional features make sense to pursue next, based on user feedback (if available) or evolving product goals.

However, if you do want to capture the next logical layer of potential enhancements now, here are 10 more tickets focusing on adding depth to the features we've already introduced:

Sprint 6: Deeper Dives & Feature Refinement (Tickets 51-60)

Ticket FE-51: Implement Detailed Challenge View Page
Description: Create a dynamic route app/challenges/[id]/page.tsx. When a user clicks a challenge in the browser (FE-31), navigate here to show more details (full description, difficulty, tags, mock success rate/average completion time if available from mock data). Include the "Start Challenge" button.
Acceptance Criteria: /challenges/[id] page exists. Fetches mock challenge details using challengeService.useGetChallengeById. Displays all relevant info. "Start Challenge" button works.
Priority: Medium (Enhances Challenge Browser).
Ticket FE-52: Implement Detailed User Progress History View

Ticket FE-54: Allow Updating Traits/Attitudes Post-Assessment
Description: Add functionality (perhaps on the /profile/edit page or the detailed personality view) allowing users to retake or adjust their personality trait and AI attitude ratings after the initial assessment. Simulate saving these using mock mutation hooks.
Acceptance Criteria: UI exists to modify trait/attitude scores. Saving triggers mock mutation hooks (personalityService.useUpdateTraits, useUpdateAttitudes - needs creation). Store (useGameStore) is updated.
Priority: Low (Refinement/User Control).
Ticket FE-55: Simulate Challenge Compatibility Display
Description: When viewing challenge details (FE-51) or browsing challenges (FE-31), fetch a mock "compatibility score" using a new mock hook personalityService.useGetChallengeCompatibility. Display this score (e.g., "Good fit for your profile!", "Requires stretching your [Trait] skill") based on the mock response.
Acceptance Criteria: Mock compatibility hook exists. Challenge views display a mock compatibility indicator based on the user's (mock) personality.
Priority: Low (Gamification/Personalization).
Ticket FE-56: Enhance User Context Form with Autocomplete Simulation
Description: For the "City/Location" input in the User Context Form (FE-2), simulate an autocomplete suggestion list using a hardcoded list of cities or a simple filtering mechanism on typing. This mimics Google Places Autocomplete purely on the frontend.
Acceptance Criteria: Typing in the City input shows a dropdown of mock suggestions. Selecting a suggestion populates the input.
Tech Notes: Use Shadcn Command or a custom dropdown implementation.
Priority: Low (UX Polish).
Ticket FE-57: Implement UI for User Preferences Categories
Description: Expand the SettingsPanel (FE-FIX-3, FE-29) to use Tabs to organize settings according to the categories in UserPreferences.yaml (UI, Notifications, AI Interaction, Learning). Implement UI controls (Switches, Selects) for at least the UI and Learning preferences defined in the schemas.
Acceptance Criteria: Settings panel uses tabs. UI controls for theme, font size, animations (UI) and preferred difficulty, learning style (Learning) exist and are connected to useUserPreferencesStore.
Priority: Medium (Completing Settings Feature).
Ticket FE-58: Add Onboarding Tooltips/Hints
Description: Implement simple tooltips or info popovers (using Shadcn Tooltip or Popover) for the first time a user encounters key sections like Trait Assessment, Attitude Assessment, and Focus Selection, explaining the purpose briefly. Use useUserPreferencesStore (add a flag like showTutorials) to control visibility and allow disabling.
Acceptance Criteria: First-time users see brief explanations for key assessment steps. Tooltips can be disabled via settings.
Priority: Medium (Onboarding UX).
Ticket FE-59: Add Basic Animation to State Transitions
Description: Add subtle transitions (e.g., fade-in/out) between game phases/screens using Framer Motion or simple CSS transitions, controlled by the animationsEnabled flag in useUserPreferencesStore. Focus on the transitions between assessment steps and rounds.
Acceptance Criteria: Smooth visual transitions occur between key game screens. Animations can be disabled in settings.
Priority: Low (UI Polish).
Ticket FE-60: Code Documentation Pass (JSDoc)
Description: Add JSDoc comments to major components (TraitAssessment, FocusSelection, Round components, ResultsProfile, Dashboard), custom hooks, and key functions in services and stores to improve maintainability.
Acceptance Criteria: Key parts of the codebase have clear JSDoc documentation explaining their purpose, props, and state usage.
Priority: Low (Maintainability).
This brings us to 60 tickets total. This batch further deepens the features introduced earlier and adds significant polish. I strongly suggest tackling the first 50 before diving deep into this last batch, but they are here for completeness if you want the full potential mapped out now.
