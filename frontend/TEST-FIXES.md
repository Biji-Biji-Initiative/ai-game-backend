# Test Environment Fixes

We've made several improvements to the test environment to fix TypeScript typing issues and provide better support for testing React components:

## Fixed Issues

1. **TypeScript Definitions**: Added proper type definitions for Jest matchers and Testing Library functions to resolve TypeScript errors:
   - Created `src/tests/jest-dom.d.ts`
   - Created `src/tests/testing-library-matchers.d.ts`
   - Created `src/tests/jest-setup.ts`

2. **Mock Store Structure**: Updated `createMockGameStore` to properly handle both formats for trait data:
   - Direct `traits` property for backward compatibility
   - Nested `personality.traits` for newer components

3. **UI Component Mocks**: Added comprehensive mocks for shadcn/ui components:
   - Created mocks for Button, Card, Select, and other components
   - Implemented simple DOM-based testing versions

4. **Test Configuration**: Improved Jest and TypeScript configuration:
   - Updated Jest configuration to properly handle TypeScript
   - Fixed Babel configuration for JSX transpilation
   - Added proper tsconfig for tests

## How to Properly Write Tests

1. **Import test setup**:
   ```typescript
   import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
   import '@/tests/jest-setup';
   ```

2. **Use flexible text matching**:
   ```typescript
   // Better than exact text matching
   expect(screen.getByText((content) => content.includes('partial text'))).toBeInTheDocument();
   ```

3. **Structure mock store data correctly**:
   ```typescript
   const mockStore = createMockGameStore({
     personality: {
       traits: mockTraits,
       attitudes: []
     }
   });
   ```

4. **Use query functions strategically**:
   - `getByText` - Use when element must exist (throws if not found)
   - `queryByText` - Use when element might not exist (returns null)
   - `findByText` - Use for async elements (returns Promise)

## Remaining Issues to Address

1. **Component Test Failures**: Many component tests are failing due to text matching issues or incorrect mock data.

2. **API Service Mocks**: Some tests need proper API service mocks that return data in the expected format.

3. **Async Test Timeouts**: Several tests are timing out and need proper async handling.
