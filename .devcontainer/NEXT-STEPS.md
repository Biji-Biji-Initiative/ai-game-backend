 # Next Steps for GitHub Codespaces Setup

Your codebase is now configured to work with GitHub Codespaces. Here are the next steps to complete the setup:

## 1. Set Up GitHub Codespaces Secrets

Since your code contains sensitive environment variables (API keys, database credentials), you should:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on Settings > Secrets and variables > Codespaces
3. Add the following secrets:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
   - `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
   - Any other sensitive values in your .env files

## 2. Test Your Configuration

1. Create a new Codespace from your GitHub repository
2. Wait for the setup script to complete
3. Verify that all .env files were created correctly
4. Start each project individually to ensure they work:
   - `cd backend && npm run dev`
   - `cd frontend && npm run dev`
   - `cd api-tester-ui && npm start`
   - `cd admin && npm start` (if applicable)

## 3. Update Project-Specific Documentation

Make sure each project's README includes information about running in Codespaces:

1. Update `backend/README.md`
2. Update `frontend/README.md`
3. Update `api-tester-ui/README.md` (if exists)
4. Update `admin/README.md` (if exists)

## 4. Customize for Your Workflow

Depending on your specific workflow, you might want to:

1. Add custom tasks to `.vscode/tasks.json`
2. Configure launch configurations in `.vscode/launch.json`
3. Set up multi-project debugging
4. Add project-specific VS Code extension recommendations

## 5. Consider Additional Improvements

For even better Codespaces experience:

1. Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to test your Codespaces configuration
2. Create a `postStartCommand` in devcontainer.json for additional setup
3. Configure prebuilds to speed up Codespace creation
4. Add a custom VS Code sidebar to help navigate between projects

## 6. Share with Your Team

Once everything is working correctly:

1. Commit all configuration files to your repository
2. Document how team members should use Codespaces
3. Ensure all team members have access to any required secrets

## 7. Regular Maintenance

As your project evolves:

1. Keep environment templates up to date with new variables
2. Update the setup script if new projects are added
3. Update the Dockerfile if new system dependencies are needed
4. Maintain a list of all required secrets for new team members
