# Documentation Standards

This document defines the standards for creating and maintaining documentation in our project.

## General Principles

1. **Up-to-Date**: Documentation should be kept in sync with code changes
2. **Concise**: Write clearly and concisely, avoiding unnecessary verbosity
3. **Consistent**: Use consistent formatting, terminology, and structure
4. **Audience-Aware**: Consider the intended audience (developers, users, etc.)
5. **Searchable**: Use appropriate headers and keywords to make content discoverable

## File Organization

### Directory Structure

Documentation should be organized into the following directories:

- `/docs/architecture/` - System architecture and design patterns
- `/docs/api/` - API documentation and references
- `/docs/guides/` - Development and usage guides
- `/docs/testing/` - Testing strategies and patterns
- `/docs/_historical/` - Archived documentation (for reference only)

### File Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `error-handling.md`)
- Be descriptive but concise
- Avoid generic names like `info.md` or `doc.md`
- Include the document type in the name when helpful (e.g., `jwt-authentication-guide.md`)

## Document Structure

### Standard Sections

Each document should include:

1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive title as an H1 (`# Title`)
2. **Overview/Introduction**: Brief explanation of the document's purpose
3. **Main Content**: Organized into logical sections
4. **Related Resources** (if applicable): Links to related documentation
5. **Appendices** (if applicable): Additional information, examples, or references

### Headers

Use headers to organize content hierarchically:

- H1 (`#`): Document title (only one per document)
- H2 (`##`): Major sections
- H3 (`###`): Subsections
- H4 (`####`): Minor subsections
- Avoid going deeper than H4 when possible

### README Files

Each directory should contain a README.md that:

1. Explains the purpose of the directory
2. Lists and briefly describes each document in the directory
3. Provides guidance on where to find specific information

## Formatting

### Markdown Conventions

- Use Markdown formatting consistently
- Include a blank line before and after headers
- Use code blocks with language specification:
  ```javascript
  // JavaScript code example
  function example() {
    return 'Hello, world!';
  }
  ```
- Use bullet points (`-`) for unordered lists
- Use numbered lists (`1.`) for sequential or prioritized items
- Use blockquotes (`>`) for important notes or quotes
- Use **bold** for emphasis and *italic* for secondary emphasis

### Code Examples

- Include language identifier with code blocks
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Include comments to explain complex code
- Keep examples concise but complete enough to understand
- Ensure examples are accurate and tested

### Tables

Use tables for structured data:

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Value 1  | Value 2  |
| Value 3  | Value 4  |
```

### Links

- Use relative links for internal documentation
- Use descriptive link text, not "click here" or URLs as text
- Check links regularly to ensure they're not broken

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style

- Use active voice instead of passive voice
- Write in present tense
- Be concise and direct
- Use technical terminology appropriately
- Define acronyms and technical terms on first use

### Visual Elements

- Include diagrams for complex systems or workflows
- Use screenshots when helpful for UI-related documentation
- Ensure images have alt text for accessibility
- Keep file sizes reasonable for images

### Examples

- Provide realistic examples that demonstrate actual use cases
- Include both simple and more complex examples when appropriate
- Ensure examples are runnable and accurate

## Documentation Types

### Architecture Documentation

Should include:
- Design principles
- System components
- Interaction patterns
- Decision rationales

### API Documentation

Should include:
- Endpoint descriptions
- Request/response formats
- Authentication requirements
- Error handling
- Example requests

### Guide Documentation

Should include:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Prerequisites
- Expected outcomes
- Common issues and solutions

### Testing Documentation

Should include:
- Testing strategies
- Test categories
- Example tests
- Mocking approaches

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Update Process

Documentation should be updated:
- When code it describes changes
- When errors or omissions are found
- When clarification is needed

### Review Process

Documentation should be reviewed for:
- Technical accuracy
- Completeness
- Clarity
- Consistency with standards

### Archiving Process

When documentation becomes obsolete:
1. Move it to the `_historical` directory
2. Update any references to it
3. Add a note about when and why it was archived

## Special Documentation Types

### ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

- Store in `/docs/architecture/adr/`
- Number sequentially (e.g., `adr-001-use-postgresql.md`)
- Include status, context, decision, and consequences

### Change Logs

- Keep a running log of significant changes
- Use date-based entries (newest first)
- Link to relevant tickets or PRs

### API Versioning Documentation

- Document breaking changes between API versions
- Provide migration paths for clients
- Include deprecation notices and timelines

## Tools and Integration

### Documentation Generation

- Use JSDoc/TSDoc for code documentation
- Configure automated documentation generation
- Store generated documentation in `/docs/reference/`

### Diagramming

- Use PlantUML, Mermaid, or draw.io for diagrams
- Store diagram source files alongside rendered images
- Include instructions for editing diagrams

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributors should:
- Follow the standards in this document
- Update documentation alongside code changes
- Get documentation reviewed as part of the PR process
- Test code examples to ensure they work
