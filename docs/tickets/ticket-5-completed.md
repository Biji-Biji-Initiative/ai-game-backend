# Ticket 5: Refactor and Simplify Swagger Configuration/Setup

## Summary
The Swagger configuration and setup has been refactored to follow the Single Responsibility Principle, reduce complexity, and make the Swagger setup more maintainable.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Dedicated Swagger Setup Module
- Created a new file `src/config/swaggerSetup.js` that handles all Swagger initialization logic
- The module exports a clean `initializeSwagger(app, logger)` function that properly sets up Swagger documentation
- The setup includes error handling to prevent application crashes if documentation fails to initialize

### 2. Simplified app.js
- Removed complex conditional Swagger initialization logic from `app.js`
- Replaced approximately 200 lines of Swagger setup code with a single function call
- Removed the static OpenAPI definition that was duplicated in `app.js`
- Removed unused import statements for `swaggerUi` and `swaggerJsDoc`

### 3. Improved swagger.js
- Ensured `src/config/swagger.js` serves as the single source of truth for the Swagger definition
- Removed duplication between `swagger.js` and the previous inline definition in `app.js`
- Simplified the Swagger options structure for better maintainability

### 4. Created Documentation
- Added comprehensive documentation in `docs/architecture/swagger-configuration.md`
- Updated the main documentation index to include the new Swagger documentation

## Acceptance Criteria Status

1. ✅ Swagger initialization logic extracted from app.js into a dedicated module/function
2. ✅ Static OpenAPI definition in app.js removed, relying on swagger-jsdoc for generation
3. ✅ Complex HTML fallback mechanism simplified with a cleaner error handling approach
4. ✅ swagger.js now serves as the single source of truth for the Swagger definition base

## Benefits
- Better adherence to Single Responsibility Principle
- Reduced complexity in application initialization
- More maintainable Swagger setup
- Less duplication of OpenAPI definitions
- Clearer documentation for future developers
- Simpler error handling for documentation failures
