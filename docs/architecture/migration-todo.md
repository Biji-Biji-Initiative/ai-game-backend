# DDD Migration - Remaining Work

This document outlines the remaining work needed to complete the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) migration.

## Completed Tasks

1. ✅ **Infrastructure Layer Implementation**
   - ✅ Created proper infrastructure layer in `src/core/infra`
   - ✅ Moved logging to `src/core/infra/logging`
   - ✅ Moved error handling to `src/core/infra/errors`
   - ✅ Moved dependency injection to `src/core/infra/di`
   - ✅ Moved database access to `src/core/infra/db`
   - ✅ Moved authentication middleware to `src/core/infra/http/middleware`

2. ✅ **Utility Migration**
   - ✅ Moved challenge utilities to domain services
   - ✅ Moved user trait utilities to domain services
   - ✅ Moved performance metrics to domain services
   - ✅ Moved fallback challenges to domain code
   - ✅ Moved prompt builders to domain code

3. ✅ **Controller Implementation**
   - ✅ Created UserController in the user domain
   - ✅ Created ChallengeController in the challenge domain
   - ✅ Created UserJourneyController in the userJourney domain
   - ✅ Created FocusAreaController in the focusArea domain
   - ✅ Updated route imports to point to new controller locations

4. ✅ **Domain Event System Implementation**
   - ✅ Implemented robust domain event system
   - ✅ Created domain events for all domains
   - ✅ Set up event handlers and subscriptions
   - ✅ Updated app.js to register event handlers during startup

5. ✅ **Repository Implementation**
   - ✅ Created PromptRepository to complete domain repositories
   - ✅ Ensured all repositories follow consistent patterns

6. ✅ **Fix Import Paths** 
   - ✅ Updated remaining import paths that referenced old locations
   - ✅ Created missing infrastructure components (API client, error classes)
   - ✅ Ensured database connection utilities follow DDD principles

7. ✅ **Finalize Route Updates**
   - ✅ Updated route files to use the new controller and middleware locations
   - ✅ Made sure all routes work with the new structure

## Immediate Tasks

1. **Finalize Route Updates**
   - Update remaining route files to use the new controller and middleware locations
   - Test all routes to ensure they work with the new structure

## Medium-Term Tasks

1. **Enhance Domain Models**
   - Add more behavior to domain models
   - Implement proper validation in constructors
   - Use value objects for complex attributes

2. **Improve Application Coordinator Pattern**
   - Ensure application coordinators don't contain domain logic
   - Create more specific use case implementations

3. **Improve Repository Implementation**
   - Ensure all repositories follow the same pattern
   - Implement proper transactional support

## Long-Term Tasks

1. **Introduce Aggregate Pattern**
   - Identify aggregates in the domain model
   - Implement proper aggregate roots with consistency guarantees

2. **Implement CQRS Pattern**
   - Separate command and query responsibilities
   - Implement specialized read models

3. **Event Sourcing Consideration**
   - Evaluate event sourcing for some domains
   - Implement event store for critical domains if needed

4. **Integration Event System**
   - Implement integration events for external systems
   - Ensure proper event schema versioning

## Migration Progress Tracking

| Domain | Models | Services | Repositories | Controllers | Events | Status |
|--------|--------|----------|--------------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Challenge | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Complete |
| User | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Complete |
| UserJourney | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Complete |
| FocusArea | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Complete |
| Evaluation | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Complete |
| Personality | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Complete |
| Progress | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Complete |
| Adaptive | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Complete |
| Prompt | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Complete |

## Notes on Testing

- Update tests to reflect the new architecture
- Consider implementing domain-specific test helpers
- Ensure proper isolation of test cases
- Consider implementing BDD-style tests that focus on behavior rather than implementation

## Deployment Considerations

- Update CI/CD pipelines to handle the new architecture
- Consider feature flags during migration period
- Implement proper monitoring for the new architecture
- Ensure backward compatibility where needed
