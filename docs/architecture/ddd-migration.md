# DDD Migration Process

This document details the process of migrating the application from a traditional layered architecture to a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture.

## Migration Steps

### 1. Identified Core Domains

We identified the following bounded contexts in the application:

- **User**: Managing user profiles and authentication
- **Challenge**: Managing challenge generation, submission, and evaluation
- **UserJourney**: Tracking user progress through the platform
- **Personality**: Handling user personality traits and preferences
- **FocusArea**: Managing learning focus areas
- **Evaluation**: Evaluating challenge responses
- **Progress**: Tracking user progress
- **Adaptive**: Adaptive learning algorithms
- **Prompt**: LLM prompt generation and management

### 2. Infrastructure Concerns

We separated cross-cutting infrastructure concerns from domain code:

- **Logging**: Moved to `src/core/infra/logging`
- **Error Handling**: Moved to `src/core/infra/errors`
- **Dependency Injection**: Moved to `src/core/infra/di`
- **Database Access**: Moved to `src/core/infra/db`

### 3. Application Layer

We created application coordinators that orchestrate across domains:

- **ChallengeCoordinator**: Orchestrates challenge-related flows
- **FocusAreaCoordinator**: Orchestrates focus area-related flows
- **UserJourneyCoordinator**: Orchestrates user journey tracking

### 4. Domain Model Enrichment

We enriched domain models with behavior and validation:

- Added domain logic to models
- Implemented validation in constructors
- Created value objects for complex attributes

### 5. Repository Implementation

We implemented proper repositories for each domain:

- Added proper mapping between database and domain objects
- Ensured repositories follow domain boundaries
- Implemented aggregate persistence

### 6. Domain Service Implementation

We moved utility functions to proper domain services:

- **ChallengeUtils** → **ChallengeUtils Service**
- **PerformanceMetrics** → **ChallengePerformanceService**
- **TraitUtils** → **UserTraitsService**

### 7. Domain Event System

We implemented a domain event system for cross-domain communication:

- Used domain events to handle cases where multiple domains need to interact
- Ensured loose coupling between bounded contexts

## Technical Migration Details

### Utility Migration

1. Identified utilities that contained domain logic
2. Created domain services in appropriate bounded contexts
3. Moved logic to domain services
4. Updated all imports
5. Injected proper dependencies

### Repository Migration

1. Identified existing repositories
2. Created proper domain repositories
3. Implemented mapping between database and domain objects
4. Updated container registrations

### Infrastructure Migration

1. Identified cross-cutting concerns
2. Created infrastructure layer structure
3. Moved utilities to proper infrastructure services
4. Updated dependencies in container

### Dependency Cleanup

1. Created proper constructor-based dependency injection
2. Updated container registrations
3. Ensured correct layer dependencies

## Code Structure Changes

### Before Migration

```
src/
├── services/          # Application services
├── repositories/      # Data access repositories
├── utils/             # Utility functions
│   ├── challenge/     # Challenge utilities
│   ├── db/            # Database utilities
│   ├── user/          # User utilities
│   └── performance/   # Performance utilities
├── models/            # Data models
└── routes/            # API routes
```

### After Migration

```
src/
├── application/        # Application coordinators
├── core/               # Domain layer
│   ├── challenge/      # Challenge domain
│   │   ├── models/     # Challenge domain models
│   │   ├── repositories/ # Challenge repositories
│   │   └── services/   # Challenge domain services
│   ├── user/           # User domain
│   ├── userJourney/    # User journey domain
│   └── infra/          # Infrastructure concerns
│       ├── db/         # Database infrastructure
│       ├── di/         # Dependency injection
│       ├── errors/     # Error handling
│       └── logging/    # Logging infrastructure
├── lib/                # External service clients
└── routes/             # API routes
```

## Best Practices to Follow

When working with the new architecture, follow these guidelines:

1. **Domain Boundaries**: Respect domain boundaries; don't bypass them
2. **Domain Logic**: Keep domain logic in domain models and services
3. **Infrastructure Separation**: Keep infrastructure concerns separate from domain logic
4. **Application Coordination**: Use application coordinators for cross-domain flows
5. **Event-Based Communication**: Use domain events for cross-domain communication
6. **Proper Dependency Injection**: Inject dependencies via constructors
7. **Clean Dependencies**: Follow dependency rules (domain → application → infrastructure)

## Future Improvements

1. Complete the migration of remaining utility functions
2. Implement more value objects for domain concepts
3. Add more domain events for cross-domain communication
4. Enhance domain model validation
5. Improve documentation of the domain model
