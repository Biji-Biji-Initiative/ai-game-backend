# ADR-001: Adoption of Domain-Driven Design

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2023-09-15

## Context
As our application continued to grow in complexity, we faced several challenges with the previous layered architecture:

1. **Business Logic Fragmentation**: Business rules were scattered across controllers, services, and models, making it difficult to enforce consistent rules.

2. **Tight Coupling**: Components were tightly coupled, making changes difficult and often resulting in cascading modifications across multiple files.

3. **Limited Test Isolation**: The tight coupling made it challenging to test components in isolation.

4. **Unclear Boundaries**: The lack of clear domain boundaries made it difficult to reason about the system as a whole.

5. **Scaling Development**: As the team grew, it became increasingly difficult for developers to understand and navigate the codebase.

We needed an architectural approach that would allow us to:
- Model complex business domains more effectively
- Establish clear boundaries and responsibilities
- Reduce coupling between components
- Facilitate better testing
- Scale development across multiple team members

## Decision
We have decided to adopt Domain-Driven Design (DDD) as our architectural approach. Specifically, we will:

1. **Organize by Bounded Contexts**: Restructure the codebase around distinct bounded contexts (Challenge, User, Evaluation, Focus Area, etc.)

2. **Implement Core DDD Building Blocks**:
   - Domain Entities with rich behavior
   - Value Objects for immutable concepts
   - Aggregates to enforce consistency boundaries
   - Domain Events for cross-boundary communication
   - Repositories for data access abstraction

3. **Apply a Layered Architecture** within each bounded context:
   - Domain Layer (core business logic)
   - Application Layer (use cases, coordination)
   - Infrastructure Layer (technical implementations)
   - Interface Layer (controllers, views)

4. **Use Ubiquitous Language**: Establish a consistent language shared between developers and domain experts.

5. **Implement Domain Events**: For loose coupling between bounded contexts.

6. **Apply the Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access details from the domain model.

## Consequences

### Positive
1. **Clear Boundaries**: Each domain has clear responsibilities and boundaries.
2. **Improved Testability**: Domains can be tested in isolation.
3. **Better Knowledge Encapsulation**: Business rules are encapsulated within the domain models.
4. **Reduced Coupling**: Domains communicate through well-defined interfaces and events.
5. **Improved Team Scalability**: Teams can focus on specific domains.
6. **Better Alignment with Business**: The code structure mirrors the business domains.

### Negative
1. **Learning Curve**: DDD concepts require time for the team to learn and apply correctly.
2. **Increased Initial Complexity**: The architecture introduces more components initially.
3. **Migration Effort**: Significant refactoring required to migrate from the previous architecture.
4. **Overhead for Simple Problems**: For simple CRUD operations, DDD may introduce unnecessary complexity.

### Mitigations
1. **Gradual Migration**: Implement DDD incrementally, starting with the most complex domains.
2. **Training**: Provide DDD training and resources for the team.
3. **Code Reviews**: Enforce DDD principles through code reviews.
4. **Documentation**: Document the architecture and patterns.
