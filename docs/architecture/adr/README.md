# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains records of significant architectural decisions made during the development of the project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architectural Decision Record is a document that captures an important architectural decision made, along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this format:

```
# ADR-NNN: Title

## Status

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences

```
