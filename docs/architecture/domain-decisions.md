# Domain-Specific Architectural Decisions

This document captures key architectural decisions made for each domain in our system.

## Decision Record Format

Each decision follows a consistent format:

- **Context**: What is the background information needed to understand the decision?
- **Decision**: What specific architectural choice was made?
- **Reasoning**: Why was this particular approach chosen?
- **Consequences**: What are the implications of this decision?
- **Alternatives Considered**: What other options were evaluated?
- **Status**: Current state (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)

## User Domain Decisions

### UD-1: User Aggregate Design

- **Context**: The User domain needed to define what belongs in the User aggregate.
- **Decision**: The User aggregate includes core identity, profile data, and preferences, but excludes progress information and focus areas.
- **Reasoning**: Progress and focus area information changes frequently and is conceptually separate from core user identity.
- **Consequences**: Progress tracking is handled by a separate domain, requiring coordination through events.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Including all user-related data in a single large aggregate.
- **Status**: Accepted

### UD-2: UserDTO Pattern for External APIs

- **Context**: User data needs to be shared with other domains and the API layer.

- **Reasoning**: Prevents leaking domain entities and allows for different representations of user data.
- **Consequences**: Requires maintaining mapping logic but provides a clean separation.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Directly exposing User entities or using serialization attributes.
- **Status**: Accepted

### UD-3: User Authentication Separation

- **Context**: Authentication logic needs to be separated from user domain logic.
- **Decision**: Create a separate Auth domain that coordinates with the User domain.
- **Reasoning**: Separates security concerns from user management, following single responsibility principle.

- **Alternatives Considered**: Simpler tracking at only one or two levels.
- **Status**: Accepted

### PD-2: Progress Update Triggers

- **Context**: Progress needs to be updated based on user activities.
