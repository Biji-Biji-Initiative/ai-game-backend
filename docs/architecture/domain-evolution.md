## Architectural Patterns and Guidelines

### Cross-Aggregate Query Strategy

We've defined a comprehensive strategy for handling queries that span multiple aggregates while maintaining DDD principles. This strategy includes:

1. Classification of cross-aggregate queries into three types:
   - Read-Only Reference Queries (simple queries across aggregates)
   - Relationship-Based Queries (queries based on natural relationships)
   - Complex Cross-Domain Queries (queries requiring data from multiple domains)

2. Recommended patterns for implementation:
   - Repository methods with clear documentation
   - Application Services as composition layers
   - Dedicated Read Models for complex views
   - Event-driven denormalization for performance-critical views

3. Implementation guidelines for different contexts:
   - Documentation requirements
   - Value Object usage
   - Error handling
   - Caching strategies

For detailed guidelines, see [Cross-Aggregate Query Strategy](./cross-aggregate-query-strategy.md).
