# AI Gaming Backend Project Overview

## Introduction

The AI Gaming Backend is a Node.js-based system designed to power an educational gaming platform that uses AI to create personalized learning experiences for users. This document provides a high-level overview of the project, its goals, architecture, and key components.

## Project Goals

The AI Gaming Backend serves to:

1. **Deliver personalized learning experiences** through AI-driven game challenges
2. **Track user progress** across different skill areas
3. **Adapt challenge difficulty** based on user performance
4. **Generate contextual feedback** to help users improve
5. **Provide analytics** for measuring learning outcomes

## System Architecture

The system follows a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** approach, organizing code around business domains using a layered architecture:

### Architecture Layers

1. **API Layer**: Handles HTTP requests, authentication, and routing
2. **Application Layer**: Orchestrates use cases and coordinates domain operations
3. **Domain Layer**: Contains core business logic, models, and rules
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Provides technical capabilities like database access, external services, and dependency injection

### Core Domains

The system is organized into the following domains:

- **User**: User profiles, authentication, and preferences
- **Personality**: User learning styles and AI personalization
- **Challenge**: Game challenges, tasks, and content
- **Focus Area**: Learning areas and skill categories
- **Evaluation**: Assessment of user solutions and performance
- **Progress**: User advancement and achievement tracking

## Technology Stack

The backend is built with the following technologies:

- **Runtime**: Node.js with ESM modules
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- **Authentication**: JWT with Supabase integration
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for response generation
- **Testing**: Jest and Supertest
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Deployment**: Docker, PM2, and Nginx

## Key Features

1. **AI-Powered Challenge Generation**: Creates tailored learning challenges based on user skill level
2. **Real-time Feedback System**: Provides immediate guidance on user solutions
3. **Adaptive Difficulty Scaling**: Adjusts challenge complexity based on user performance
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitors user advancement across different skill areas
5. **User Personalization**: Customizes experience based on learning style and preferences
6. **Learning Analytics**: Provides insights into user learning patterns and outcomes
