# DDD-04: Refine Aggregate Boundaries and Consistency Rules

## Summary

This refactoring focused on reinforcing proper Domain-Driven Design principles related to aggregate boundaries and consistency rules. We enhanced the User and Challenge aggregates by enforcing invariants, properly validating state changes, and ensuring that all modifications go through the Aggregate Root.

## Changes Made

1. Added domain-specific error types for invalid state transitions:
   - `ChallengeInvalidStateError` - For Challenge entities in invalid states
   - `UserInvalidStateError` - For User entities in invalid states

2. Added invariant enforcement in the Challenge model:
   - Implemented `_enforceInvariants()` method to check all consistency rules
   - Strengthened validation in domain methods like `submitResponses()`, `complete()`, and `update()`
   - Added state transition validations (e.g., completed challenges must have evaluations)
   - Incorporated Value Objects for proper validation

3. Improved User model consistency:
   - Implemented `_enforceInvariants()` method with user-specific validations
   - Enforced validation in methods like `completeOnboarding()`, `removeRole()`, `recordLogin()`
   - Added validations for state transitions (e.g., cannot complete onboarding without focus area)
   - Integrated Value Objects for stronger type safety

4. Replaced generic errors with domain-specific errors:
   - Proper domain errors provide more meaningful information
   - Errors now include relevant context and validation details
   - Consistent error handling across the domain

5. Strengthened aggregate boundaries:
   - All state changes must go through aggregate root methods
   - Protected critical state from direct modification
   - Ensured invariants are checked after every state change

## Why This Change Was Needed

The previous implementation had several issues:

1. **Inconsistent State Management** - Aggregate methods could leave the entity in an inconsistent state
2. **Weak Validation** - Some validation was scattered or missing entirely
3. **Generic Error Handling** - Generic errors provided little domain context
4. **Insufficient State Transition Rules** - State transitions weren't properly enforced

## Implementation Details

### Challenge Domain

The Challenge aggregate now ensures:

- Completed challenges must have an evaluation
- Submitted challenges must have at least one response
- Status transitions follow valid paths (e.g., cannot regress from completed to submitted)
- Critical fields like responses cannot be modified after submission
- All operations respect the current state of the Challenge

### User Domain

The User aggregate now ensures:

- Users must have at least one role
- Only active users can record logins
- Onboarding completion requires a focus area
- User status follows valid transitions
- Focus areas are properly validated using Value Objects

## Benefits

1. **Stronger Domain Integrity** - Impossible to bring entities into invalid states
2. **Clearer Error Messages** - Domain-specific errors provide better information
3. **Self-Protecting Aggregates** - Aggregates protect their own invariants
4. **Consistent Validation** - All state changes are validated consistently
5. **Better Domain Expression** - Business rules are explicitly coded in the domain model
