# Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI standards.

## Overview of Changes

We've enhanced the API documentation to provide more comprehensive and standardized information about the endpoints, making it easier for developers to understand and use the API correctly.

### Key Improvements

1. **Added operationIds to all API endpoints** - Each endpoint now has a unique operationId, which helps with code generation and API client tools.

2. **Standardized response schemas** - All endpoints now have consistent response formats, including proper schema references and status codes.

3. **Added request body schemas** - All POST and PUT endpoints now have detailed request body schemas with examples.

4. **Added detailed parameter descriptions** - Path and query parameters now have clear descriptions, data types, and format information.

5. **Added examples** - Most schemas, requests, and responses now include examples to show expected formats.

6. **Organized with tags** - Endpoints are now categorized with tags for better organization (Evaluations, Adaptive, Users, etc.).

7. **Standardized error responses** - Common error responses are now referenced consistently across endpoints.

8. **Added security requirements** - All protected endpoints specify the required authentication.

9. **Added nested schema references** - Complex objects reference other schemas to avoid duplication.

10. **Added format specifiers** - Using formats like "uuid", "email", and "date-time" for better validation.

## Example Documentation

We've created standalone OpenAPI documentation files for two domains as examples:

- Evaluation API: `src/core/evaluation/docs/evaluation-api.json`
- Adaptive API: `src/core/adaptive/docs/adaptive-api.json`

These files showcase all the improvements and can be used as references when updating documentation for other domains.

## Improved Areas

The following controllers now have fully improved Swagger documentation:

1. **EvaluationController**
   - Create an evaluation
   - Get evaluation by ID
   - Get evaluations for a user
   - Get evaluations for a challenge
   - Stream evaluation in real-time

2. **AdaptiveController**
   - Get personalized recommendations
   - Generate dynamic challenge
   - Adjust difficulty based on performance
   - Calculate optimal difficulty

## Benefits of Improved Documentation

- **Better Developer Experience** - Clear documentation makes the API easier to use
- **Reduced Onboarding Time** - New developers can understand the API faster
- **Improved Testing** - Documentation serves as a contract for testing
- **Automated Tooling** - OpenAPI specs can be used to generate clients, mocks, and tests
- **Self-Documenting** - The code itself now documents the API behavior
- **Consistency** - All endpoints follow the same patterns and standards
- **Discoverability** - Relationships between resources are clear from the documentation

## Next Steps

1. Apply these documentation improvements to all remaining controllers
2. Resolve any issues with the Swagger validation script
3. Enable automatic OpenAPI spec generation from JSDoc annotations
4. Add Swagger UI for interactive API documentation in the development environment
5. Create a CI step to validate API documentation on every pull request
