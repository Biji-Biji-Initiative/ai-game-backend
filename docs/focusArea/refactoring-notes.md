# Focus Area Management Refactoring

## JIRA-8: Refactoring FocusArea Retrieval/Generation Logic

### Overview

The original implementation of `FocusAreaManagementCoordinator.getFocusAreas` had mixed responsibilities, coupling the retrieval of existing focus areas with the logic to potentially generate new ones. This made the code less maintainable and its behavior less explicit to callers.

### Changes Made

1. **Refactored `getFocusAreas` method** to have clearer separation of concerns:
   - Split the logic into separate private methods:
     - `retrieveExistingFocusAreas`: Focuses solely on retrieving existing focus areas
     - `generateFocusAreas`: Focuses solely on generating new focus areas
   - Made the primary method a clean orchestrator of these two specialized methods

2. **Improved method signature** to make the "find or generate" responsibility more explicit:
   - Changed `forceRefresh` parameter to more descriptive options:
     - `generateIfMissing: true` (default): Controls whether to generate focus areas if none exist
     - `forceRegeneration: false` (default): Controls whether to regenerate even when focus areas exist
   - This provides better control and clearer documentation of the expected behavior

3. **Updated dependent code**:
   - Updated `FocusAreaCoordinatorFacade` to reflect the new parameter names
   - Updated documentation to reflect the new behavior

### Benefits

1. **Improved Clarity**: Each method now has a single responsibility, making the code easier to understand
2. **Better Testability**: Separate methods can be tested independently
3. **More Explicit API**: Method parameters now clearly communicate the behavior options
4. **Reduced Coupling**: Clearer separation between retrieval and generation responsibilities

### Migration Notes

- Code that previously used `forceRefresh: true` should now use `forceRegeneration: true` 
- Code that expected focus areas to always be generated if missing doesn't need changes (default behavior)
- To disable automatic generation when focus areas are missing, set `generateIfMissing: false`
