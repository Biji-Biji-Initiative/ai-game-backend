# JIRA-16: Remove Empty ChallengeUtilityService.js

## Summary
Successfully removed the empty `ChallengeUtilityService.js` file that contained only a constructor with no actual utility methods. This cleanup helps reduce codebase clutter and removes unused components.

## Verification Steps

### 1. Verified that ChallengeUtilityService was not used anywhere
- No imports of ChallengeUtilityService found in the codebase
- No instances of ChallengeUtilityService being instantiated
- The service was not registered in the DI container

### 2. References to the file
- Only non-code references found in:
  - JIRA documentation
  - Service reports (likely auto-generated)
  - JIRA-10-SUMMARY.md (mentioned as an example for logger validation pattern)

### 3. File Content
The file contained:
- A class definition with JSDoc comments
- A constructor that validated logger dependency
- No actual utility methods or functionality

## Actions Taken
- Deleted the file: `/src/core/challenge/services/ChallengeUtilityService.js`
- No need to update DI container as the service was not registered

## Acceptance Criteria Met
✅ The empty ChallengeUtilityService.js file is removed from the codebase.
✅ The application should build and run correctly without the file since it was not being used.

## Additional Notes
The service was mentioned in JIRA-10-SUMMARY.md as an example for the correct pattern for logger validation. This reference is now historical and can remain, as it doesn't affect functionality.
