# JIRA-13 Implementation: Remove Mock Fallbacks in Production Service Constructors

## Implementation Summary

We've successfully implemented the JIRA-13 requirements to remove mock fallbacks in production service constructors. This ensures that our application fails fast in production when critical dependencies are missing, rather than silently running with mock implementations which could lead to unpredictable behavior.

## Changes Made

1. Created a `ConfigurationError` class for handling dependency injection issues:
   - File: `/src/core/infra/errors/ConfigurationError.js`
   - Purpose: Provides a specialized error type for configuration and dependency issues
   - Includes useful metadata like service name and dependency name

2. Updated service constructors to fail fast in production environments when required dependencies are missing:

   - **ChallengeService**:
     - Now throws `ConfigurationError` when `challengeRepository` is missing in production
     - Maintains mock fallbacks only in development/testing environments

   - **UserService**:
     - Now throws `ConfigurationError` when `userRepository` or `cacheService` are missing in production
     - Reorganized constructor to separate production vs. development initialization
     - Maintains in-memory cache fallback only in development/testing environments

   - **FocusAreaThreadService**:
     - Now throws `ConfigurationError` when `openAIStateManager` is missing in production
     - Provides more detailed error information in production mode

3. Improved error messages to provide more context about the missing dependencies, including:
   - The service name that has the missing dependency
   - The specific dependency name that is missing
   - Clear indication that this is a configuration issue

## Testing

These changes should be tested with the following scenarios:

1. **Production Environment**:
   - Services should throw `ConfigurationError` when required dependencies are missing
   - Error messages should clearly indicate which dependency is missing
   - Application should fail to start if critical services can't be initialized

2. **Development Environment**:
   - Services should still use mock fallbacks for easier local development
   - Warning logs should indicate when mock implementations are being used
   - Application should still function even with some missing dependencies

## Next Steps

This implementation pattern could be extended to other services not covered in this update. The following services might benefit from a similar approach:

- AuthService
- Progress-related services
- Evaluation-related services
- Any other service with dependency injection and mock fallbacks
