# Ticket #7: Ensure Data Mapper Pattern Consistency

## Summary of Changes

We've implemented the Data Mapper pattern for the `Recommendation` domain model in the Adaptive domain, ensuring separation of concerns between domain logic and persistence.

### Changes Made:

1. **Created RecommendationMapper.js**
   - Added methods to convert between domain and persistence formats:
     - `toPersistence`: Converts Recommendation domain entities to database format
     - `toDomain`: Converts database data to Recommendation domain entities
     - `toDomainCollection`: Converts database collections to domain entity collections

2. **Removed Persistence Logic from Domain Model**
   - Deleted the `toDatabase()` method from Recommendation.js
   - Domain entity is now purely focused on business logic, not persistence concerns

3. **Updated AdaptiveRepository to Use Mapper**
   - Added mapper import and integration
   - Modified save method to use `recommendationMapper.toPersistence()` instead of `recommendation.toDatabase()`
   - Updated fetch methods to use `recommendationMapper.toDomain()` and `toDomainCollection()`
   - Improved code readability with additional comments

## Benefits of This Pattern

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Domain models focus exclusively on business logic
   - Persistence logic is isolated in mappers
   - Repository coordinates between mappers and data source

2. **Improved Testability**
   - Domain models can be tested without database dependencies
   - Mapping logic can be tested independently

3. **Flexibility for Data Structure Changes**
   - Changes to database structure only require updates to mappers
   - Domain models remain stable even when persistence details change

4. **Consistency Across the Codebase**
   - Follows the same pattern used in other domains (Progress, Challenge, etc.)

## Other Domain Models to Review

The pattern should be consistently applied to all domain models. Other models that might need similar updates include:

1. Any remaining domain models with `toDatabase()` or similar methods
2. Domain models with persistence-specific naming (snake_case field handling)
3. Repositories that directly use domain model methods for persistence conversion

This implementation serves as a template for applying the Data Mapper pattern consistently throughout the codebase.
