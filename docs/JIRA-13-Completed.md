# JIRA-13: Service Constructor Dependency Validation Implementation

## Summary
Implemented the solution for JIRA-13 to prevent services from starting with mock repositories in production environments. This implementation includes a centralized utility function and updates to service constructors to use this common pattern.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created a Centralized Utility Function
Created `validateDependencies` helper function in `/src/core/shared/utils/serviceUtils.js`:
- Validates that required dependencies are provided
- Supports production-only mode (default) 
- Throws ConfigurationError with detailed information when validation fails

### 2. Updated Service Constructors
Modified the following service constructors to use the centralized validation pattern:

**a. ChallengeService**
- Updated to properly validate dependencies using the utility function
- Removed mock fallbacks in production mode
- Improved organization of constructor code

**b. PersonalityService**
- Refactored constructor signature to use a dependencies object for consistency
- Added validation for required dependencies
- Reorganized mock fallback logic to only apply in non-production environments

**c. UserService**
- Simplified dependency validation using the utility function
- Preserved existing fallback functionality in development environment
- Maintained backwards compatibility

### 3. Key Principles Applied
- **Fail Fast**: Services now validate dependencies at instantiation time
- **Production Safety**: Prevents accidental use of mock repositories in production
- **Developer Experience**: Retains convenient fallbacks in development environments
- **Standardization**: Consistent pattern across services
- **Clear Error Messages**: Specific error messages that identify the missing dependency

## Testing
The implementation has been tested in development mode to ensure fallbacks still work properly, and dependency validation has been verified to function correctly in both environments.

## Benefits
- Increased robustness in production environment
- Standardized approach to dependency validation
- Improved error messages for missing dependencies
- Simplified service constructors with reusable validation logic

## Future Work
Consider applying this pattern to all remaining services in the codebase, potentially as part of a separate ticket.
