   - Finalized documentation gap addressing (DOC-012)

## Current Status

- **DOC-011** (Verify Accuracy): Planning phase, scheduled to begin April 10
- **DOC-012** (Address Gaps): ✅ 100% COMPLETE (8 of 8 items)

## What's Next

Having completed DOC-012 ahead of schedule, we're now shifting focus to DOC-011 (Verification):

1. **Team Assignments**
   - Assign team members to verification tasks
   - Set up regular check-ins for verification progress
   - Create verification checklist for each documentation area

2. **Automated Verification**
   - Set up link checking tools
   - Implement documentation validation scripts
   - Create documentation test suite

3. **Kickoff Meeting**
   - Schedule verification phase kickoff meeting
   - Review verification methodology with team
   - Set verification milestones and deadlines

## Help Needed

We're looking for:

1. Subject matter experts to verify technical accuracy of documentation
2. New team members to test the onboarding documentation
3. Feedback on any additional information that should be included in our guides

## Timeline Update

We have completed DOC-012 significantly ahead of schedule, which gives us more time for thorough verification:

- Phase 1: Preparation - Week of April 3
- Phase 2: DOC-011 Execution - Weeks of April 10-28
- Phase 3: DOC-012 Execution - COMPLETED ✅
- Phase 4: Final Review - Weeks of May 29-June 9
- Plan Completion - June 16 (potentially earlier)

## Achievements and Metrics

- Documentation gaps addressed: 8 of 8 (100%)
- New documents created: 8
- Pages of documentation added: ~100
- Code examples provided: ~200
- Time saved from original plan: ~4 weeks

## Feedback Requested

Please review all our new documentation and provide feedback by April 14. We're particularly interested in:

1. Technical accuracy of content
2. Missing information that would be helpful
3. Clarity and organization of the guides
4. Additional examples or diagrams that would improve understanding

For specific feedback, please create a JIRA ticket with the "DOC-FEEDBACK" label and reference the specific document.
