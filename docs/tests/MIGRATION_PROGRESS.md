## Files Requiring Manual Review

The following files need manual refactoring to fit into the new structure:

- [x] `tests/integration/focus-area-flow.test.js` - ✅ Refactored into domain and external tests
- [x] `tests/integration/challenge-evaluation-flow.test.js` - ✅ Refactored into domain, integration, and E2E tests
- [x] `tests/integration/evaluation-flow.test.js` - ✅ Refactored into domain, external, and E2E tests
- [x] `tests/integration/openai-supabase-flow.test.js` - ✅ Refactored into domain, external, integration, and E2E tests
- [x] `tests/integration/prompt-flow.test.js` - ✅ Refactored into domain, external, integration, and E2E tests
- [x] `tests/integration/user-flow.test.js` - ✅ Refactored into domain, integration, and E2E tests

## Migration Plan for Complex Tests

For the complex integration tests, we need to:

1. Analyze each test to understand its purpose
2. Split the test into multiple tests based on the new structure:
   - Domain tests focusing on intra-domain behavior
   - Integration tests focusing on cross-domain behavior
   - E2E tests for API-level testing
3. Use the in-memory repositories for domain and integration tests
4. Use HTTP calls for E2E tests

## Example Refactoring Process

### Focus Area Flow Refactoring

Using `focus-area-flow.test.js` as an example, we have:

1. Created a **domain test** `tests/domain/focusArea/focusArea.service.test.js` that:
   - Uses in-memory repositories instead of Supabase
   - Mocks the OpenAI client 
   - Tests the core service behavior in isolation

2. Created an **external test** `tests/external/openai/focusArea.external.test.js` that:
   - Tests direct integration with the OpenAI API
   - Verifies the OpenAI contract and response format

3. Created an **E2E test** `tests/e2e/focusArea.e2e.test.js` that:
   - Tests the complete HTTP API
   - Simulates real user flows

### Challenge-Evaluation Flow Refactoring

For `challenge-evaluation-flow.test.js`, we split the test into:

1. **Domain tests**:
   - `tests/domain/challenge/challenge.generation.service.test.js` - Tests challenge generation service
   - `tests/domain/evaluation/evaluation.service.test.js` - Tests evaluation service

2. **Integration test**:
   - `tests/integration/challengeEvaluation.workflow.test.js` - Tests the full workflow between domains

3. **E2E test**:
   - `tests/e2e/challengeEvaluation.e2e.test.js` - Tests the complete flow via HTTP API

### Evaluation Flow Refactoring

For `evaluation-flow.test.js`, we split the test into:

1. **Domain test**:
   - `tests/domain/evaluation/evaluation.generator.service.test.js` - Tests evaluation generation with mocked OpenAI

2. **External test**:
   - `tests/external/openai/evaluation.external.test.js` - Tests the direct integration with OpenAI

3. **E2E test**:
   - `tests/e2e/evaluation.e2e.test.js` - Tests the evaluation API endpoints

### OpenAI-Supabase Flow Refactoring

For `openai-supabase-flow.test.js`, we split the test into:

1. **Domain test**:
   - `tests/domain/challenge/challenge.ai.generator.test.js` - Tests challenge AI generation with mocked OpenAI

2. **External test**:
   - `tests/external/openai/challenge.external.test.js` - Tests the direct integration with OpenAI API

3. **Integration test**:
   - `tests/integration/openaiSupabase.workflow.test.js` - Tests the workflow between OpenAI and Supabase

4. **E2E test**:
   - `tests/e2e/challengeGeneration.e2e.test.js` - Tests the complete API flow for challenge generation

### Prompt Flow Refactoring

For `prompt-flow.test.js`, we split the test into:

1. **Domain test**:
   - `tests/domain/prompt/services/promptTemplate.generator.test.js` - Tests prompt template generation with mocked OpenAI

2. **External test**:
   - `tests/external/openai/promptTemplate.external.test.js` - Tests the direct integration with OpenAI API

3. **Integration test**:
   - `tests/integration/promptGeneration.workflow.test.js` - Tests the workflow between OpenAI and Supabase

4. **E2E test**:
   - `tests/e2e/promptTemplate.e2e.test.js` - Tests the complete API flow for prompt templates

### User Flow Refactoring

For `user-flow.test.js`, we split the test into:

1. **Domain test**:
   - `tests/domain/user/user.lifecycle.test.js` - Tests user lifecycle with in-memory repositories

2. **Integration test**:
   - `tests/integration/userStorage.workflow.test.js` - Tests the workflow between User domain and Supabase

3. **E2E test**:
   - `tests/e2e/userManagement.e2e.test.js` - Tests the complete API flow for user management

## Lessons Learned

Throughout this migration process, we've learned several important lessons:

1. **Test Isolation**: By separating concerns into domain, integration, external, and E2E tests, we've created more focused and reliable tests. Each test now has a clear responsibility.

2. **In-Memory Repositories**: Using in-memory repositories for domain tests has significantly improved test speed and reliability. Tests no longer depend on external services like Supabase.

3. **Mocking External Services**: By properly mocking external services like OpenAI, we've made tests more predictable and faster.

4. **Clear Test Structure**: The new directory structure makes it easy to find and organize tests based on their purpose and scope.

5. **Test Environment Setup**: Centralizing the test environment setup in helpers/setupTestEnv.js has made it easier to manage and configure test dependencies.

6. **Proper Error Handling**: The new test structure forces us to consider error cases and handle them properly in our code.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ All complex integration tests have been successfully refactored!
2. Run all tests to identify any remaining issues:
   - Fix domain tests that are failing due to mocking issues with eventBus
   - Fix Supabase connectivity issues in e2e and external tests 
   - Fix OpenAI response_format parameter error in focus area tests
3. Update documentation based on experience with the new structure 
4. Consider adding more domain tests for untested components
5. ✅ Clean up the old `tests/domains/` directory by either:
   - ✅ Moving it to an "archive" or "legacy" directory (moved to tests/archive/domains_old)
   - Deleting it once we verify all tests have been properly migrated

## Current Issues

After running several tests across different domains, we've identified the following issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Import Path Issues**: Many tests have incorrect import paths that need to be fixed:
   - Domain tests are importing from `../../../../src/...` but should be using `../../../src/...`
   - Some tests are looking for non-existent modules or paths 

2. **EventBus Mocking Issues**: In domain tests, eventBus.publish is undefined in User tests:
   - Error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'publish')`
   - May need to improve the mocking setup in domain tests

3. **Supabase Connectivity Problems**:
   - E2E tests failing with "Supabase credentials not found in environment variables"
   - External Supabase tests timing out with "fetch failed" errors
   - Need to ensure .env file is loaded correctly for tests

4. **OpenAI API Issues**:
   - Focus area tests failing with "response_format parameter not supported with this model"
   - May need to update the API parameters to match the latest OpenAI API specifications

The User Domain Model tests are partially working, with 24 tests passing but 10 failures. The Challenge test is failing due to mock setup issues, and most E2E tests fail due to connectivity issues.
