# ARCH-1: Formalize Bounded Context Definitions

## Overview

This implementation addresses the need to formalize Bounded Context (BC) definitions in our application. Bounded Contexts are a core concept in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) that define clear boundaries within which a particular domain model is valid.

## Problem Statement

Our codebase currently has implicit bounded contexts defined by directory structure (`core/user`, `core/challenge`, etc.). While this provides some structure, there is a lack of:

1. Formal BC documentation explaining responsibilities and relationships
2. Explicit definition of integration patterns between contexts
3. Clear guidance on shared vs. context-specific concepts
4. Visual context mapping to aid developer understanding

## Implementation Approach

### Documentation Enhancements

We created comprehensive documentation outlining the BCs in our system:

1. **Bounded Contexts Document**
   - Located at `docs/architecture/bounded-contexts.md`
   - Defines each bounded context with clear responsibilities
   - Lists key concepts, aggregates, value objects, repositories, services, and events
   - Explains integration points between contexts

2. **Context Map**
   - Located at `docs/architecture/context-map.md`
   - Provides a visual ASCII diagram of context relationships
   - Explains relationship types (Partnership, Customer-Supplier, Shared Kernel, ACL)
   - Details integration methods (Events, Shared Kernel, Repository lookups)

### Organization Enhancements

While our directory structure already reflects bounded contexts, we've enhanced its meaning by:

1. Ensuring each bounded context has its own dedicated directory under `src/core/`
2. Verifying that shared concepts are correctly placed in `src/core/common/`
3. Confirming that application services that orchestrate across contexts are in `src/application/`

## Bounded Contexts Identified

1. **User Context** (`src/core/user/`)
   - Identity, profile, authentication, authorization

2. **Challenge Context** (`src/core/challenge/`)
   - Challenge creation, retrieval, tracking

3. **Evaluation Context** (`src/core/evaluation/`)
   - Handles evaluation of challenge responses

4. **Personality Context** (`src/core/personality/`)
   - Manages user personality traits and insights

5. **Focus Area Context** (`src/core/focusArea/`)
   - Manages focus areas for challenges and users

6. **Progress Context** (`src/core/progress/`)
   - Tracks user learning journey and achievements

## Integration Patterns Used

1. **Event-Based Integration**
   - Primary method for context communication
   - Follows "collect events, dispatch after save" pattern
   - Improves system decoupling

2. **Shared Kernel**
   - Limited to essential concepts (FocusArea, common value objects)
   - Explicitly documented to avoid expanding unnecessarily

3. **Anti-Corruption Layer**
   - Used in repositories that cross context boundaries
   - Example: `ChallengeRepository.findByUserEmail()` (with appropriate deprecation)

## Benefits

The formalization of bounded contexts provides:

1. **Clearer architecture** - Developers can understand system boundaries
2. **Better onboarding** - New team members can grasp domain organization
3. **Reduced coupling** - Explicit boundaries and integration patterns
4. **Improved maintainability** - Changes can be confined to single contexts
5. **Alignment with DDD** - Strategic design patterns are explicitly applied

## Future Considerations

1. **Context Monitoring** - Consider tools to detect BC violations
2. **Event Schema Evolution** - Plan for versioning of events between contexts
3. **Context Ownership** - Assign each context to specific team members
4. **Microservice Considerations** - These BCs could form the basis for future microservices
