## OPS-701: Enhanced Logging System (COMPLETED)

### Priority: High

### Description
Enhance the existing logging system to provide more comprehensive insights, improve troubleshooting capabilities, and better integrate with the monitoring system implemented in OPS-502. The current logging system uses Winston for structured logging but needs improvements in several areas.

### Requirements

1. **Structured Logging Enhancements**
   - Implement consistent log formatting across all services
   - Add standardized contextual data to all log entries
   - Create a correlation ID system for tracing requests across services
   - Add performance timing information to relevant logs

2. **Log Aggregation and Visualization**
   - Set up centralized log storage solution
   - Configure log rotation and retention policies
   - Implement log querying capabilities
   - Create visualization dashboards for common log patterns

3. **Log Levels and Categories**
   - Refine log level usage guidelines
   - Create domain-specific loggers with appropriate namespaces
   - Add log category tagging for easier filtering
   - Implement environment-specific logging configurations

4. **Integration with Monitoring**
   - Connect logs with Sentry error reporting
   - Ensure circuit breaker state changes are properly logged
   - Add health check logging
   - Create logging hooks for key system events

5. **Performance Logging**
   - Add detailed timing for critical paths
   - Implement logging for API response times
   - Track resource usage (memory, CPU) in logs
   - Create OpenAI-specific performance logging

6. **Security Logging**
   - Enhance authentication and authorization logging
   - Implement audit logging for sensitive operations
   - Add rate limit breach logging
   - Ensure PII is properly redacted in logs

7. **Developer Experience**
   - Create helper utilities for common logging patterns
   - Add debug modes that can be enabled at runtime
   - Implement log level changes without server restart
   - Update documentation with best practices

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All logs follow a consistent, structured format
- [x] Log entries contain relevant contextual information
- [x] Request tracing works across service boundaries
- [x] Performance metrics are captured in logs
- [x] Log levels are used appropriately throughout the codebase
- [x] Log rotation and retention policies are implemented
- [x] Security-sensitive information is properly redacted
- [x] Integration with Sentry is enhanced
- [x] Circuit breaker state changes are comprehensively logged
- [x] Developer documentation is updated with logging best practices
- [x] Logging configuration can be changed at runtime

### Technical Notes

- Use the existing Winston logging framework
- Leverage AsyncLocalStorage for correlation ID propagation
- Consider implementing Log4j-style log levels for finer granularity
- Ensure minimal performance impact from logging in production
- Use environment variables for configurable logging behavior

### Related Information

- See OPS-502 for monitoring integration
- See INFRA-203 for circuit breaker implementation
- See SEC-401 for validation middleware that needs logging enhancements

### Completion Notes

âœ… Implemented on: July 17, 2023

The enhanced logging system has been fully implemented with all required features:

1. Created a new `enhancedLogger.js` module that extends Winston with advanced features
2. Implemented correlation ID tracking using AsyncLocalStorage
3. Added performance monitoring with timer utilities
4. Created comprehensive middleware for Express integration
5. Enhanced circuit breaker integration with detailed logging
6. Added security features including PII redaction
7. Created detailed documentation and usage examples

The implementation includes:
- Core logging infrastructure with configurable formatters
- Domain-specific logger factories
- Performance measurement utilities
- Request/response logging middleware
- Integration with Sentry monitoring
- Dynamic log level configuration
- Circuit breaker integration
- Security enhancements for sensitive data

Documentation and examples have been added to help developers use the new system effectively.
