Ticket: CORE-101
Title: Refactor Domain Event Publishing for Consistency
Type: Task
Priority: Medium
Component: core/personality, core/common
Status: COMPLETED
Description: Domain event publishing is inconsistent. Some models (e.g., Personality) publish events directly within methods (updateTraits, updateAttitudes), while repositories (e.g., ChallengeRepository) correctly collect events and publish them post-transaction. Direct publishing from models can lead to inconsistencies if the subsequent database operation fails.
Acceptance Criteria:
Modify all domain entities (like Personality, User, Progress) to collect domain events using addDomainEvent instead of publishing directly.
Ensure all relevant repository save/update/delete methods retrieve collected events using getDomainEvents().
Ensure all repositories use BaseRepository.withTransaction (or a similar pattern) to publish collected events only after the database transaction commits successfully.
Verify event handlers still receive expected events.

Ticket: INFRA-201
Title: Standardize Logger Usage Across Services
Type: Task
Priority: Low
Component: application/*
Status: COMPLETED
Description: Some services (e.g., ChallengeGenerationService) use a manual this.log(level, msg, ctx) method, while others directly use the injected logger methods (this.logger.info, this.logger.error). Standardize logger usage across all services and coordinators to use the injected logger instance directly (e.g., this.logger.info, this.logger.debug).
Acceptance Criteria:
Remove the manual log method from ChallengeGenerationService.
Update all log calls within ChallengeGenerationService to use this.logger.info, this.logger.debug, etc. directly.
Audit other services/coordinators for similar inconsistencies and refactor as needed.

Title: Refactor CORS Configuration in app.js
Type: Task
Priority: Low
Component: config, app
Status: COMPLETED
Description: The CORS configuration logic (checking allowed origins in production) is duplicated between app.use(cors(...)) and app.options('*', cors(...)) in src/app.js. This violates the DRY principle.
Acceptance Criteria:
Extract the CORS options generation logic into a reusable function or constant within src/app.js or src/config/config.js.
Use the shared CORS options in both app.use(cors(...)) and app.options('*', cors(...)).
Verify CORS behavior remains unchanged in development and production modes.

Title: Add Caching to UserContextService
Type: Feature Enhancement
Priority: Medium
Status: COMPLETED
Component: application/evaluation
Description: The UserContextService.gatherUserContext method fetches data from multiple repositories (userRepository, challengeRepository, evaluationRepository). This operation can be expensive and is likely called frequently during evaluations. Implement caching to improve performance.
Acceptance Criteria:
Inject cacheService into UserContextService.
Implement caching within gatherUserContext using cacheService.getOrSet.
Define an appropriate cache key structure (e.g., userContext:userId:<userId>).
Set a reasonable TTL (e.g., 5-15 minutes).
Ensure relevant cache invalidation strategies are triggered when user profile, challenge history, or evaluation history changes (likely requires updating CacheInvalidationManager or ensuring appropriate events are published and handled).

Title: Review and Refactor Magic Numbers/Rules in Mapping Logic
Type: Task
Priority: Low
Component: application/personality, application/evaluation
Status: COMPLETED
Description: Methods like PersonalityCoordinator._mapAttitudesToPreferences and potentially parts of UserContextService use hardcoded numbers (e.g., 70, 100, 150) and complex conditional logic to map domain concepts. This can make the rules hard to understand, maintain, and modify.
Acceptance Criteria:
Review the logic in _mapAttitudesToPreferences and similar calculation/mapping methods.
Consider extracting thresholds (e.g., 70, 100, 150) into configuration constants (e.g., in personalityConfig.js or evaluationConfig.js).
Evaluate if complex mapping rules could be better represented using a Strategy pattern or dedicated Policy objects, especially if the rules are likely to change based on business requirements.
Add comments explaining the rationale behind the mapping rules.

Title: Implement API Rate Limiting
Type: Feature
Priority: High
Status: COMPLETED
Component: infra/http
Description: The application currently lacks API rate limiting, making it vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks and abuse. Implement rate limiting middleware.
Acceptance Criteria:
Choose and integrate a rate limiting library (e.g., express-rate-limit).
Configure appropriate rate limits globally and potentially specific limits for sensitive endpoints (e.g., login, signup).
Ensure rate limit information is returned in response headers (e.g., X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining).
Add rate limiting configuration to src/config/config.js.

Title: Conditionally Load API Tester UI/Endpoints
Type: Task
Priority: Medium
Component: app, config
Description: The API Tester UI (/tester) and associated debugging endpoints (/api/v1/api-tester) seem to be loaded unconditionally in src/app.js. These should ideally be disabled in production environments for security and performance reasons.
Acceptance Criteria:
Modify src/app.js to conditionally mount the API Tester static files and routes only when NODE_ENV is not production.
Ensure the API Tester is accessible in development/testing but not in production builds.

Ticket: CORE-102
Title: Review Repository Query Methods
Type: Task
Priority: Low
Status: COMPLETED
Component: core/*/repositories
Description: Some repositories (e.g., ChallengeRepository) include query methods based on non-aggregate-root identifiers (e.g., findByUserEmail). While pragmatic, complex cross-aggregate queries can violate DDD principles if they bypass domain logic or aggregate boundaries excessively.
Acceptance Criteria:
Review repository methods that query based on fields other than the aggregate root ID.
Ensure these methods are simple lookups and don't involve complex joins or logic that should reside elsewhere (e.g., in a dedicated Query Service or Read Model).
Confirm that data modification operations still go through methods that load the aggregate root (e.g., findById then save).
Add comments justifying pragmatic deviations if necessary.

Title: Verify redisCache Dependency Registration
Type: Bug
Priority: Medium
Component: config/container
Description: The openAIStateManager registration in src/config/container/infrastructure.js references c.get('redisCache'), but there is no explicit registration for redisCache shown in the provided infrastructure.js or other container files. This could lead to runtime errors if Redis caching is intended but not configured.
Acceptance Criteria:
Verify if redisCache is registered elsewhere or if it's a missing dependency.
If Redis caching is intended, add the necessary registration for redisCache (likely involving RedisCacheProvider) in infrastructure.js.
If Redis caching is not intended for openAIStateManager, update its registration to remove the dependency or provide a null/mock cache.

Ticket: CORE-103
Title: Improve AppError Handling in supabaseClient.js
Type: Task
Priority: Low
Component: core/infra/db
Description: The error handling during Supabase client initialization in supabaseClient.js throws a generic Error in production if initialization fails. This could prevent graceful degradation or specific error handling downstream.
Acceptance Criteria:
Modify the error handling to throw a specific InfrastructureError or a custom SupabaseInitializationError extending AppError.
Ensure the error includes relevant context about the failure.
Verify that the application startup process handles this specific error type appropriately (e.g., logs critically and exits).

This review provides a detailed analysis and actionable steps to further enhance the codebase's quality, maintainability, and adherence to DDD and SOLID principles. The codebase demonstrates a strong foundation and good architectural choices. The suggested improvements focus mostly on consistency, refinement, and addressing potential minor issues.
