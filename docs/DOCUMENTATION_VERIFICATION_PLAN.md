# Documentation Verification Plan (DOC-011)

## Overview

This document outlines our plan for verifying the accuracy and effectiveness of all documentation in the AI Gaming Backend project. The verification process will ensure that our documentation is technically accurate, complete, and serves the needs of our target audiences.

## Verification Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Preparation (April 3-7, 2023)
- **Phase 2**: Initial Verification (April 10-21, 2023)
- **Phase 3**: Feedback Incorporation (April 24-May 5, 2023)
- **Phase 4**: Final Verification (May 8-19, 2023)
- **Phase 5**: User Testing (May 22-June 2, 2023)
- **Completion**: June 9, 2023

## Verification Checklist

Each document will be verified against the following criteria:

### Technical Accuracy
- [ ] Information is factually correct
- [ ] Code examples are functional and follow best practices
- [ ] Commands and instructions work as described
- [ ] Architecture descriptions match the actual system
- [ ] API documentation matches the actual implementation

### Completeness
- [ ] All major features and functions are documented
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios are addressed
- [ ] No critical information is missing
- [ ] Prerequisites and dependencies are clearly stated

### Usability
- [ ] Documentation is well-organized and easy to navigate
- [ ] Complex concepts are explained clearly
- [ ] Appropriate examples and diagrams are provided
- [ ] Links to related documentation are provided

### Consistency
- [ ] Terminology is used consistently
- [ ] Style and formatting are consistent
- [ ] Documentation structure follows our standards
- [ ] Cross-references are correct and useful

## Verification Process

### 1. Automated Checks

We will implement automated checks to verify:

- Link validity (no broken links)
- Document structure compliance
- Code snippet syntax checking
- Screenshot/image inclusion
- Spelling and grammar

**Tools:**
- `markdown-link-check` for verifying links
- Custom scripts for structure validation
- Code linters for snippets
- Spell checker with technical dictionary

### 2. Technical Review

Each document will be assigned to a subject matter expert for technical review:

1. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Reviewer: Senior Architect
   - Focus: System design accuracy, current practices

2. **API Documentation**
   - Reviewer: API Team Lead
   - Focus: Endpoint accuracy, request/response examples

3. **Setup & Development Guides**
   - Reviewer: Dev Tooling Team
   - Focus: Environment setup instructions, workflow accuracy

4. **Testing Documentation**
   - Reviewer: QA Lead
   - Focus: Test strategy, execution instructions

5. **Production & Deployment**
   - Reviewer: DevOps Engineer
   - Focus: Deployment procedures, monitoring setup

### 3. User Testing

We will conduct user testing with:

1. **New Developers**
   - Tasks: Set up development environment, make a simple change
   - Measurement: Time to completion, obstacles encountered

2. **Experienced Developers**
   - Tasks: Implement new feature, troubleshoot common issues
   - Measurement: Documentation reference frequency, accuracy of understanding

3. **Operations Team**
   - Tasks: Deploy changes, monitor system, respond to incidents
   - Measurement: Procedure effectiveness, missing information

### 4. Feedback Incorporation

For each document, we will:

1. Collect all feedback (automated, expert, user)
2. Prioritize issues by severity and impact
3. Make necessary corrections
4. Verify corrections with original reviewers
5. Document verification status

## Reporting & Tracking

We will track verification progress using:

1. Weekly status reports (every Friday)
2. Daily stand-up updates in the #documentation Slack channel
3. JIRA tickets for identified issues (using DOC-VERIFY-### format)
4. A verification dashboard showing overall progress

## Exit Criteria

The verification phase (DOC-011) will be considered complete when:

1. All documents have been reviewed by assigned subject matter experts
2. All critical and high-priority issues have been resolved
3. User testing has been completed with positive results
4. Automated checks pass for all documentation
5. Documentation project stakeholders have signed off on the verification

## Resources Required

- **Time Commitment**: 2-4 hours per document for SME reviewers
- **User Testing**: 3-5 new developers for onboarding test
- **Technical Writers**: Support for revisions and clarifications
- **Automation**: Developer time to set up verification tools

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| SME availability limited | Schedule reviews well in advance, break into smaller chunks |
| User testing delays | Identify backup testers, create detailed test scripts |
| High volume of issues found | Prioritize rigorously, focus on critical user paths first |
| Technical drift during verification | Implement change freeze for documented systems where possible |

## Next Steps

1. Assign verification owners for each document category
2. Set up automated verification tooling
3. Schedule kickoff meeting with all reviewers
4. Create detailed verification templates for reviewers
5. Begin verification of highest-priority documents
