# Repository Documentation

This directory contains all documentation for the project. The documentation has been consolidated from across the repository into a single location for easier access and management.

## Directory Structure

The documentation follows the same structure as the original codebase to maintain context:

- `/docs/src/` - Documentation from the source code directories
- `/docs/tests/` - Documentation related to testing
- `/docs/scripts/` - Documentation for scripts and utilities
- `/docs/api-tester-ui/` - Documentation for the API tester UI
- `/docs/.github/` - GitHub-related documentation

## Root Documents

Key documents at the root level:

- `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - API documentation
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Guide for contributors
- `ESM_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of the ESM migration
- `PRODUCTION.md` - Production deployment information
- `START_GUIDE.md` - Getting started guide
- `TicketstoHeaven.md` - Project tickets and roadmap

## Documentation Log

The file `moved_files.log` contains a record of all documentation files that were moved from their original locations to this directory. You can use this to trace the original location of any document.

## Next Steps

1. Review all documentation to ensure it's still relevant and up-to-date
2. Organize the documentation into logical categories if needed
3. Update any references between documents to point to their new locations
4. Consider adding a search capability or better navigation structure
5. Establish a consistent documentation format going forward
