# Ticket 29: Standardize Cross-Aggregate Query Strategy - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Ticket 29 required defining and documenting a clear strategy for handling cross-aggregate queries in our DDD architecture. This implementation introduces a comprehensive approach to managing queries that span multiple aggregates while maintaining domain integrity.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation

- **Created cross-aggregate-query-strategy.md**
  - Comprehensive guidelines for different types of cross-aggregate queries
  - Decision framework for choosing appropriate implementation patterns
  - Best practices for repository methods, application services, and read models
  - Examples from our codebase

- **Updated domain-evolution.md**
  - Added section on Cross-Aggregate Query Strategy
  - Referenced the detailed strategy document

### 2. Repository Documentation Improvements

- **Enhanced challengeRepository.js**
  - Added explicit documentation for all cross-aggregate query methods
  - Clarified coupling concerns in methods like `findByUserEmail`
  - Made recommendations for alternative approaches where appropriate
  - Ensured consistent use of value objects for cross-aggregate references

### 3. Sample Read Model Implementation

- **Created UserDashboardReadModel.js**
  - Demonstrates the Complex Cross-Domain Query pattern
  - Shows how to compose data from multiple repositories
  - Implements caching for performance optimization
  - Includes proper error handling and logging

### 4. Event-Driven Denormalization Sample

- **Created UserStatsViewService.js**
  - Implements the event-driven denormalization pattern
  - Shows how to eliminate cross-aggregate queries at read time
  - Demonstrates event handling for maintaining a denormalized view
  - Includes specialized update operations for statistics

## Strategy Summary

The implemented strategy classifies cross-aggregate queries into three categories:

1. **Read-Only Reference Queries**: Simple queries referencing other aggregates (e.g., finding challenges by user ID)
2. **Relationship-Based Queries**: Queries involving naturally related aggregates (e.g., finding progress for a challenge)
3. **Complex Cross-Domain Queries**: Queries requiring data from multiple domains (e.g., user dashboards)

For each category, we provide specific implementation patterns:

1. Repository methods with explicit documentation for simple cases
2. Application services for composition of multiple aggregates
3. Dedicated read models for complex views requiring multiple aggregates
4. Event-driven denormalization for performance-critical views

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Clear Guidelines**: Developers now have explicit criteria for when and how to implement cross-aggregate queries
2. **Consistent Documentation**: Standardized approach to documenting cross-aggregate queries
3. **Performance Optimization**: Patterns for addressing performance concerns with complex queries
4. **Domain Integrity**: Preservation of aggregate boundaries while allowing practical data access needs

## Testing Notes

The following scenarios should be tested:

1. Simple cross-aggregate queries using repository methods
2. Complex queries using application services
3. Dashboard views using the read model
4. Event-driven updates to the user stats view

## Next Steps

1. Apply the documented patterns to other repositories in the system
2. Create database migration for the user_stats_view table
3. Consider implementing additional read models for other complex views
4. Add monitoring for performance of cross-aggregate queries
