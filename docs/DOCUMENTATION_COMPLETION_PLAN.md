# Documentation Completion Plan

This document outlines the plan for addressing the remaining documentation tickets DOC-011 (Verify Accuracy) and DOC-012 (Address Gaps).

## DOC-011: Verifying Documentation Accuracy

### Objective

Ensure all documentation is technically accurate, up-to-date, and consistent with the current codebase.

### Verification Process

1. **Automated Verification**
   - Check all internal links with a Markdown link checker
   - Verify code examples compile/run correctly
   - Check for outdated references to libraries, versions, etc.

2. **Manual Review by Domain**
   - Assign specific domains to subject matter experts
   - Cross-reference documentation with code implementation
   - Verify configuration options match actual available options
   - Check command examples for correctness

3. **Documentation Testing**
   - Have developers unfamiliar with specific areas follow the documentation
   - Note any confusion, errors, or missing steps
   - Try to set up a new environment using only the documentation

### Prioritization

Review documentation in this order of priority:

1. API documentation
2. Setup guides
3. Architecture documentation
4. Testing documentation
5. Production guides
6. Remaining documentation

### Timeline

- Week 1: Automated verification and link checking
- Week 2: Manual review of API and setup documentation
- Week 3: Manual review of architecture and testing documentation
- Week 4: Manual review of remaining documentation
- Week 5: Address issues found during review

4. **Completed** - Documentation that has passed all reviews

Weekly status reports will be generated to track:
- Number of documents verified/created
- Issues identified and resolved
- Remaining work and estimated completion time

## Final Deliverables

Upon completion of this plan, we will deliver:

1. A comprehensive, accurate documentation set
2. A summary report of verification activities
3. New documentation for all identified gaps
4. A maintenance plan for keeping documentation current

This plan will ensure our documentation is complete, accurate, and valuable for all users of our system.
