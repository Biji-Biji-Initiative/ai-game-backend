# API Versioning Strategy

This document outlines our strategy for versioning the API endpoints to ensure backward compatibility while allowing for evolutionary changes.

## Why Version APIs?

API versioning is essential for:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Allowing existing clients to continue functioning even as the API evolves
2. **Feature Evolution**: Enabling the addition of new features or modifications to existing endpoints
3. **Deprecation Strategy**: Providing a clear path for retiring outdated functionality
4. **Client Transition**: Giving clients time to migrate to newer versions at their own pace

## Our Versioning Approach

We use **URI-based versioning** in our API, where the version number is included in the path:

```
https://api.example.com/v1/games
https://api.example.com/v2/games
```

### Version Numbering

- We use **major version numbers only** (v1, v2, v3)
- Incremented only for breaking changes
- Non-breaking changes are made within the same version

## When to Create a New Version

Create a new API version when making any of these breaking changes:

1. **Removing or renaming fields** in responses
2. **Changing field types or formats** (e.g., string to integer)
3. **Removing endpoints** entirely
4. **Changing response status codes** for the same scenario
5. **Adding required request parameters** or changing parameter requirements
6. **Changing authentication mechanisms**

## When NOT to Create a New Version

The following changes should be made within the current version:

1. **Adding new endpoints**
2. **Adding new fields** to responses (clients can ignore them)
3. **Adding optional parameters** to requests
4. **Bug fixes** that maintain the same behavior
5. **Performance improvements** that don't affect functionality

## Version Lifecycle

Each API version goes through these stages:

1. **Active**: Fully supported, receives bug fixes and possibly enhancements
2. **Deprecated**: Still functional but scheduled for removal, receives only critical bug fixes
3. **Sunset**: No longer available, returns 410 Gone status

### Timeline Guidelines

- **Active period**: Minimum 1 year
- **Deprecation period**: Minimum 6 months with notifications to clients
- **Total lifespan**: We support at most 2 major versions concurrently

## Implementation Details

### URI Structure

```
/api/v{version_number}/{resource}/{id}
```

Example:
```
/api/v1/games/123
```

### Version in Response Headers

In addition to URI versioning, we include the API version in response headers:

```
API-Version: v1
```

### Handling Cross-Version Requests

For resources that haven't changed between versions, the newer version endpoints should proxy to the older version's implementation.

## Documentation Requirements

For each version:

1. Maintain complete documentation of all endpoints
2. Clearly mark deprecated endpoints
3. Provide migration guides between versions
4. Include version release notes highlighting changes

## Version Migration Strategy

When releasing a new API version:

1. **Communicate Early**: Announce the upcoming version at least 3 months in advance
2. **Provide Migration Guide**: Document all changes and how to update client code
3. **Offer Testing Environment**: Allow clients to test against the new version before release
4. **Monitor Adoption**: Track usage of old and new versions
5. **Send Reminders**: Notify clients using deprecated versions periodically

## Testing Requirements

For each API version:

1. Maintain separate integration test suites
2. Ensure backward compatibility tests for non-breaking changes
3. Run all version test suites in CI/CD pipeline

## Example Version Transition

Consider a transition from v1 to v2:

**v1 Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/v1/players/{id}
Response: { "id": 123, "name": "Player1", "score": 100 }
```

**v2 Changes:**
- Rename "score" to "points"
- Add "level" field

**v2 Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/v2/players/{id}
Response: { "id": 123, "name": "Player1", "points": 100, "level": 5 }
```

During the transition period, both endpoints would be active.

## Version Support Policy

We commit to:

1. Supporting each version for a minimum of 18 months (12 active + 6 deprecated)
2. Providing at least 6 months notice before sunsetting any version
3. Publishing a roadmap of planned version releases and retirements
4. Prioritizing critical security fixes across all supported versions

## Handling Emergency Situations

In case of security vulnerabilities or critical issues:

1. We may bypass the standard versioning process to deploy fixes
2. Changes will be documented after deployment
3. Clients will be notified as soon as possible

## API Version Management Tools

We use the following tools to help manage our API versions:

1. API Gateway for routing requests to the correct version
2. Automated testing for version compatibility
3. API usage metrics to track version adoption
4. Documentation generation per version
