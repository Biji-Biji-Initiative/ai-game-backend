# Guide for New Developers: Understanding the API Documentation

Welcome to the AI Gaming Backend API documentation! This guide will help you navigate and understand our API documentation, even if you're not a technical expert.

## Overview of Documentation Structure

Our API is organized into logical domains, each with its own documentation:

1. **[API Documentation Overview](./README.md)** - Start here for a high-level understanding
2. **[API Endpoints Reference](./endpoints.md)** - A comprehensive list of all available endpoints
3. **[Common Patterns](./common-patterns.md)** - Conventions and patterns used throughout the API

## Domain-specific Documentation

Each domain in our system has its own detailed documentation:

- **[Authentication API](./authentication.md)** - How to authenticate with the API
- **[User API](./user-api.md)** - Manage user profiles and settings
- **[Challenge API](./challenge-api.md)** - Generate and interact with challenges
- **[Evaluation API](./evaluation-api.md)** - Access challenge evaluations and feedback
- **[Focus Area API](./focus-area-api.md)** - Browse learning topics and skill areas
- **[Personality API](./personality-api.md)** - Customize AI personalities
- **[Progress API](./progress-api.md)** - Track learning progress

## How to Read an API Endpoint

Each endpoint is documented with:

1. **HTTP Method and URL** - For example: `GET /api/v1/challenges`
2. **Description** - What the endpoint does
3. **Request Parameters** - What information you need to provide
4. **Response Format** - What data you'll receive back
5. **Example Requests and Responses** - Real-world examples

## Authentication

Most API endpoints require authentication. Look at the [Authentication Documentation](./authentication.md) to understand:

- How to register and login
- How to include authentication tokens in requests
- How to refresh expired tokens

## Making Your First API Request

Here's a simple example of how to make an API request:

```bash
# Login to get a token
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "securePassword123"}'

# Use the token to make an authenticated request
curl -X GET https://api.example.com/api/v1/users/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

## Common Response Formats

All API responses follow a consistent format:

### Success Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // The requested data
  },
  "meta": {
    // Additional information like pagination
  }
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human-readable error message"
  }
}
```

## API Versioning

Our API uses versioning to ensure backward compatibility. All current endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1/`. For more details, see the [API Versioning Strategy](./versioning-strategy.md).

## Getting Help

If you're stuck or have questions about the API:

1. Check the [Common Patterns](./common-patterns.md) document
2. Look for examples in the endpoint-specific documentation
3. Contact the development team for assistance

## Next Steps

1. Browse the [API Endpoints Reference](./endpoints.md) to see all available endpoints
2. Try out the authentication flow to get a token
3. Explore the domain that's most relevant to your needs
4. Use the interactive API documentation at http://localhost:3000/api-docs when the server is running
