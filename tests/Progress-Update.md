  - Updated `Progress-Update.md` with the cleanup details
  - Documented the current test structure and naming conventions
  - Added instructions for future test maintenance

## Comprehensive Solution

We've implemented a robust test suite preparation script (`fix-test-suite.sh`) that:

1. Fixes import paths in both test and source files
2. Corrects module alias imports (`@/core` and `@/config`)
3. Converts any remaining CommonJS to ES modules
4. Fixes ESM-related issues like missing extensions and `__dirname` usage
5. Updates error handling to use domain-specific errors
6. Verifies and updates the Supabase schema
7. Runs basic tests to verify connectivity

Additionally, we've now addressed the structural organization of the test suite with the new `clean-test-suite.sh` script that:

1. Identifies and removes duplicate test files
2. Moves tests to their proper locations
3. Normalizes file naming conventions
4. Consolidates redundant test coverage
5. Cleans up the overall test structure

## Documentation

We've created comprehensive documentation:

- `ESM_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Explains how to migrate from CommonJS to ES modules
- `DEPENDENCY_INJECTION_PATTERNS.md` - Explains DI best practices and refactoring patterns 
- `TEST_SCRIPTS_REFERENCE.md` - Reference for all test-related scripts
- `TEST_CLEANUP_GUIDE.md` - Detailed guide for the test cleanup process
- Multiple scripts with detailed comments for future maintenance
- This progress update document to track the refactoring effort 

## Final Status

All test-related tickets (T1-T20) are now complete, along with additional structural improvements to the test folder. The test suite is now well-organized, follows consistent naming conventions, and eliminates redundancies and duplications. Future test development should follow the patterns established in the documentation to maintain the clean structure.
