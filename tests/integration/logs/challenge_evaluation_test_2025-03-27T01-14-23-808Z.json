The committee is considering a new policy that would grant AI researchers access to anonymized user data to drive advancements in healthcare AI. However, there are concerns about potential privacy breaches and the adequacy of anonymization techniques.\n\nYour task is to develop a proposal that addresses the following points:\n1. Propose a framework for accessing user data that maintains both user privacy and fosters innovation.\n2. Identify potential risks in the proposed framework and suggest mitigations.\n3. Consider ethical implications and provide a justification for decisions made regarding user consent, transparency, and accountability.\n\nThe committee has requested a document that is both comprehensive and concise, ranging between 500-700 words."
