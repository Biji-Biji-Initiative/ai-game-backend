        "description": "You find a mysterious letter hidden in an old book while browsing at a garage sale. The letter contains a series of unusual, seemingly random numbers: 17, 34, 51, 42, 59, 68, 75. Beneath these numbers, a scribbled note reads: 'Unlock the sequence to reveal the secret word.' You realize that the numbers correlate with positions of letters in the English alphabet somehow. Your challenge is to decipher the rule behind this sequence and identify the missing letter that completes the sequence."
