        "description": "You find yourself in a dimly lit room with a huge chessboard on the table. However, this is no ordinary chessboard. Each square on the board is engraved with a unique symbol and a number from 1 to 64 (as there are 64 squares on a chessboard). Each number corresponds to its position on the board in standard chess notation, starting with 1 at a1 and ending with 64 at h8. \n\nYour challenge is to determine the sequence in which the squares are numbered by identifying the pattern that governs them. You notice that the numbers are not in a straightforward incremental order. Instead, they seem to follow a specific path across the board. \n\nTo solve the puzzle, you must: \n1. Analyze the arrangement of numbers and symbols. \n2. Identify any pattern, symmetry, or mathematical sequence common to the arrangement. \n3. Explain the path or rule governing the sequence of numbers on the chessboard.\n\nCan you unravel the logic behind this numerical mystery and uncover the hidden sequence?"
