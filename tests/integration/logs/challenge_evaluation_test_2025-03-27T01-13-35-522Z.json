        "description": "As the head of a tech company's AI innovation team, you are tasked with designing a new AI-powered product that enhances user experience by collecting and analyzing personal data such as location, purchase history, and search queries. However, this raises privacy concerns among potential users and privacy advocacy groups. Your challenge is to propose a strategic plan that balances the pursuit of innovation with ethical considerations around user privacy. You must address the following elements:\n\n1. Identify potential ethical issues the product may face and the impact on stakeholder trust.\n2. Propose a guideline for ethical data usage that complies with major privacy regulations such as GDPR or CCPA.\n3. Suggest a mechanism for obtaining user consent while maintaining transparency and simplicity.\n4. Develop a strategy to continuously evaluate and improve the AI system's ethical compliance post-launch.\n\nYour response should present a coherent strategy that considers both the commercial goals and ethical responsibilities of the company."
