          "description": "Imagine you are part of a team developing AI for an autonomous vehicle. Your team's project is nearing completion, but you've encountered a significant ethical dilemma: the vehicle must make decisions in potentially dangerous scenarios, such as a sudden obstacle appearing in the road. One team member suggests that the vehicle should prioritize the safety of pedestrians over passengers at all times, while another argues that the passengers' safety should come first since they are the ones using the vehicle's service. Your task is to propose a balanced decision-making framework for the autonomous vehicle that addresses this ethical dilemma, ensuring fairness and minimizing harm. Consider factors such as legal responsibility, public acceptance, and moral philosophies in your framework."
