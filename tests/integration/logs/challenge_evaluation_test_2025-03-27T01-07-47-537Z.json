          "description": "You are part of the design team for a new autonomous vehicle. A recent incident has sparked a debate: In a near-collision scenario, the vehicle’s algorithm must decide whom to prioritize for safety - the passengers inside the vehicle or pedestrians on the road. Different stakeholders have varied priorities: manufacturers prioritize brand reputation, governments focus on public safety, and the public looks for accountability and trust. Your task is to design a decision-making framework for the vehicle’s algorithms that considers these ethical dimensions. In 500 words, outline your approach, addressing potential ethical conflicts, stakeholder impacts, and propose a transparent method for decision-making and accountability. Justify your choices with ethical theories or principles where applicable."
