          "description": "You find yourself on a mysterious, circular island with a radius of exactly 10 kilometers. In the center of this island is a mountain, which is 5 kilometers high, and all the way around the island is a perfectly circular, dense forest with a narrow path leading to a treasure hidden at some point on the island's edge.\n\nYou have a map with symbols marked for water sources, but no bearings or directions. Your map has five symbols, each representing a specific geographical feature which repeats equally and infinitely around the island. The riddle on the map reads as follows:\n\n1. Start at the center of the island.\n2. Follow the path: Mountain, Stream, Cave, Rock, Beach.\n3. Repeat this sequence until you have completed six cycles.\n4. The treasure is located 3 marks past the point where the mountain 'aligns' with the central peak.\n\nTo claim the treasure, identify the exact geographical feature where the treasure is located.\n\nRules:\n- Each mark is a fixed distance apart and represents a change in location where one geographical feature ends and another begins.\n- 'Alignment' means the mountain symbol on the map is directly aligned with the central peak of the island.\n- No tools like compasses or GPS are available, just your reasoning skills."
