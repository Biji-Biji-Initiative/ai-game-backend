        "description": "You find yourself on an island where every object follows a unique pattern rule. As an observer, your task is to identify which object doesnâ€™t match the others based on the patterns described. Consider five sequences of numbers, each representing the pattern followed by one object:\n\n1. Sequence A: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12\n2. Sequence B: 5, 10, 20, 40, 80\n3. Sequence C: 3, 6, 11, 18, 27\n4. Sequence D: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32\n5. Sequence E: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35\n\nDetermine which sequence of numbers doesn't fit the pattern of the other sequences. Provide a brief explanation of the rules behind the pattern for each object."
