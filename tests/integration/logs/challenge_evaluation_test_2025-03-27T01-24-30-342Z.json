Data Security: What measures will you implement to protect the data from breaches? \n4. Transparency: How will you ensure that users understand what data is being collected and how it is used? \n5. Innovation: How can the app remain innovative while respecting ethical guidelines?\n\nYour response should address these points, proposing a structured and ethical strategy for the app's development and operation."
