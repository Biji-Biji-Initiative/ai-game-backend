        "description": "You find yourself on a remote island with four lighthouses evenly spaced around its circular shore. Each lighthouse emits a unique color of light: red, blue, green, and yellow. Each night, the lighthouses follow a specific sequence: the red lighthouse turns on first, followed by the blue, then the green, and finally the yellow. However, on some nights, one lighthouse stays on longer than the others, disrupting the usual sequence. You have a notebook where you can record observations, and you must figure out which lighthouse is staying on longer, and why. Use your logical reasoning skills to identify patterns and solve the mystery of the extended light."
