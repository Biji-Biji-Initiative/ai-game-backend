# Test Cleanup and Improvement Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Test Structure Analysis and Organization**
   - Created `scripts/analyze-test-placement.js` to analyze test files and identify misplaced tests
   - Created `scripts/generate-test-relocation-script.js` to generate a script for relocating tests to their proper locations
   - Analyzed existing tests for proper placement in domain, integration, e2e, and external test categories

2. **Framework Standardization**
   - Created `scripts/convert-jest-to-chai.js` to standardize on Chai/Sinon for assertions
   - Converted Jest-style assertions to Chai-style (e.g., `expect(x).toBe(y)` â†’ `expect(x).to.equal(y)`)
   - Replaced Jest mocking patterns with Sinon equivalents

3. **Dependency Injection Patterns**
   - Created `scripts/create-di-mocking-template.js` to generate proper DI mocking templates
   - Added `tests/MOCKING_PATTERNS.md` with standardized mocking patterns
   - Documented anti-patterns to avoid, like monkey-patching and global mocks

4. **Domain Test Runner**
   - Created `scripts/run-domain-tests.js` to run only domain tests that don't use external services
   - Implemented smart filtering to exclude tests with external dependencies
   - Grouped tests by domain for better organization and reporting

5. **Event Bus Mocking**
   - Fixed the `UserService.test.js` file to properly mock the eventBus
   - Created a reusable pattern for mocking the eventBus in domain tests
   - Fixed assertions to check against the mock instead of a spy

6. **Import Path Fixing**
   - Created a script `scripts/fix-test-imports.js` to automatically fix import paths in test files
   - Tool fixes paths by replacing `../../../../src/` with `../../../src/` in domain tests

7. **OpenAI API Compatibility**
   - Created `scripts/fix-openai-params.js` to update OpenAI API calls in tests
   - Fixed `response_format` parameters to match the latest OpenAI API specs

## Usage Instructions

### Test Structure Analysis

To analyze the current test structure:
```bash
node scripts/analyze-test-placement.js
```

To generate a script for relocating tests:
```bash
node scripts/generate-test-relocation-script.js
```

### Framework Standardization

To convert Jest-style tests to Chai:
```bash
node scripts/convert-jest-to-chai.js
```

### Dependency Injection Templates

To create a new test with proper DI mocking:
```bash
node scripts/create-di-mocking-template.js user UserService
```

### Running Domain Tests

To run only domain tests without external dependencies:
```bash
node scripts/run-domain-tests.js
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test Prioritization**
   - [ ] Fix domain tests that fail due to improper mocking
   - [ ] Ensure all domain services use proper dependency injection

2. **Test Coverage Analysis**
   - [ ] Add test coverage reporting to the test runner
   - [ ] Identify and prioritize domains with low test coverage

3. **Test Performance**
   - [ ] Optimize slow tests, particularly those with heavy setup requirements
   - [ ] Add timing information to test runner output

4. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Update test documentation to reflect the new organization and best practices
   - [ ] Add examples of proper DI mocking for various domains
